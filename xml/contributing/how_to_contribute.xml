        <title>How to contribute</title>
        <paragraph>The Godot Engine is free and open-source. Like any community-driven project, we rely on volunteer contributions.
            On this page we want to showcase the various ways you as users can participate - to help you find the right starting place with the skillset you have.
            Because contrary to popular opinion, we need more than just programmers on the project!</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>We created the non-profit <reference name="Godot Foundation" refuri="https://godot.foundation/">Godot Foundation</reference><target ids="godot-foundation" names="godot\ foundation" refuri="https://godot.foundation/"></target> to be able to support the Godot Engine in both matters of finance and administration.
                        In practice, this means the Foundation hires people to work part-time or full-time on the project.
                        These jobs include engine development as well as related tasks like code reviews, production management, community &amp; marketing efforts, and more.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>With as little as 5 EUR per month, you can help us keep going strong.
                        Currently, we are intending to hire more core developers, as to cover more ground with full-time specialists that supplement and guide volunteer work.</paragraph>

                        Think about your followers on social media, or other communities you are active in.
                        Use that reach to remind your social environment that even small contributions can make a difference, especially when done by a great number of people at the same time.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Are you a content creator?

                        You heard right, simply publishing a game #MadeWithGodot can positively impact the well-being of this project.
                        Your personal success elevates the engine to a viable alternative for other developers, growing the community further.
                        Additionally, it opens the doors for us to approach industry contacts about possible cooperations.</paragraph>

                        While it is recommended to use the stable releases for your projects, you can help us test dev releases, betas, and release candidates
                        by opening a copy of your project in them and checking what problems this introduces or maybe even solves.
                        Make sure to have a backup ready, since this can produce irreversible changes.</paragraph>

                        Chances are you looked for learning materials outside of what the documentation provides.
                        Without content creators covering the game development process, there would not be this big of a community today.
                        Therefore it seemed only right to mention them in a page about important contributions to the project.</paragraph>
