            <title>Introduction</title>
            <paragraph>It is often desired to use <abbreviation explanation="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbreviation> connections (also
                known as <abbreviation explanation="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</abbreviation> connections) for communications
                to avoid "man in the middle" attacks. Godot has a connection wrapper,
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_streampeertls#class-streampeertls"><inline classes="std std-ref">StreamPeerTLS</inline></reference>, which can take a regular connection
                and add security around it. The <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_httpclient#class-httpclient"><inline classes="std std-ref">HTTPClient</inline></reference> and
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_httprequest#class-httprequest"><inline classes="std std-ref">HTTPRequest</inline></reference> classes also support HTTPS using
                this same wrapper.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Godot will try to use the TLS certificate bundle provided by the operating system,
                but also includes the
                <reference name="TLS certificate bundle from Mozilla" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/thirdparty/certs/ca-certificates.crt">TLS certificate bundle from Mozilla</reference>
                as a fallback.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>You can alternatively force your own certificate bundle in the Project Settings:</paragraph>
            <figure align="center" ids="id1">

                <caption>Setting the TLS certificate bundle override project setting</caption>
            </figure>
            <paragraph>When set, this file <emphasis>overrides</emphasis> the operating system provided bundle by default.
                This file should contain any number of public certificates in
                <reference name="PEM format" refuri="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail">PEM format</reference>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>There are two ways to obtain certificates:</paragraph>
        </section>
        <section ids="obtain-a-certificate-from-a-certificate-authority" names="obtain\ a\ certificate\ from\ a\ certificate\ authority">
            <title>Obtain a certificate from a certificate authority</title>
            <paragraph>The main approach to getting a certificate is to use a certificate authority
                (CA) such as <reference name="Let's Encrypt" refuri="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</reference>. This is a more
                cumbersome process than a self-signed certificate, but it's more "official" and
                ensures your identity is clearly represented. The resulting certificate is also
                trusted by applications such as web browsers, unlike a self-signed certificate
                which requires additional configuration on the client side before it's
                considered trusted.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>These certificates do not require any configuration on the client to work, since
                Godot already bundles the Mozilla certificate bundle in the editor and exported
                projects.</paragraph>
        </section>
        <section ids="generate-a-self-signed-certificate" names="generate\ a\ self-signed\ certificate">
            <title>Generate a self-signed certificate</title>
            <paragraph>For most use cases, it's recommended to go through certificate authority as the
                process is free with certificate authorities such as Let's Encrypt. However, if
                using a certificate authority is not an option, then you can generate a
                self-signed certificate and tell the client to consider your self-signed
                certificate as trusted.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To create a self-signed certificate, generate a private and public key pair and
                add the public key (in PEM format) to the CRT file specified in the Project
                Settings.</paragraph>
            <warning>
                <paragraph>The private key should <strong>only</strong> go to your server. The client must not have
                    access to it: otherwise, the security of the certificate will be
                    compromised.</paragraph>
            </warning>
            <warning>
                <paragraph>When specifying a self-signed certificate as TLS bundle in the project
                    settings, normal domain name validation is enforced via the certificate
                    <abbreviation explanation="common name">CN</abbreviation> and alternative names. See
                    <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_tlsoptions#class-tlsoptions"><inline classes="std std-ref">TLSOptions</inline></reference> to customize domain name validation.</paragraph>
            </warning>
            <paragraph>For development purposes Godot can generate self-signed certificates via
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_crypto#class-crypto-method-generate-self-signed-certificate"><inline classes="std std-ref">Crypto.generate_self_signed_certificate</inline></reference>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Alternatively, OpenSSL has some documentation about <reference name="generating keys" refuri="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openssl/openssl/master/doc/HOWTO/keys.txt">generating keys</reference>
                and <reference name="certificates" refuri="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openssl/openssl/master/doc/HOWTO/certificates.txt">certificates</reference>.</paragraph>
