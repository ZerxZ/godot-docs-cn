        <title>Overview of debugging tools</title>
        <paragraph>This guide will give you an overview of the available debugging tools in the
            engine.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Godot comes with a powerful debugger and profilers to track down bugs, inspect
            your game at runtime, monitor essential metrics, and measure performances.
            It also offers options to visualize collision boxes and navigation polygons
            in the running game.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Finally, you have options to debug the game running on a remote device
            and to reload changes to your scenes or your code while the game is running.</paragraph>
        <section ids="output-panel" names="output\ panel">
            <title>Output Panel</title>
            <paragraph>The output panel allows you to see text printed by the project, but also by the editor (e.g. from <literal>@tool</literal> scripts).
                You can find information about in <reference internal="True" refuri="output_panel#doc-output-panel"><inline classes="std std-ref">Output panel</inline></reference>.</paragraph>

            <title>Debugger Panel</title>
            <paragraph>Many of Godot's debugging tools are part of the Debugger panel, which you can
                find information about in <reference internal="True" refuri="debugger_panel#doc-debugger-panel"><inline classes="std std-ref">Debugger panel</inline></reference>.</paragraph>

        <section ids="debug-menu-options" names="debug\ menu\ options">
            <title>Debug menu options</title>
            <paragraph>There are a few common debug options you can toggle on or off when running
                your game in the editor, which can help you in debugging your game.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>You can find these options in the <strong>Debug</strong> editor menu.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Here are the descriptions of the options:</paragraph>
            <section ids="deploy-with-remote-debug" names="deploy\ with\ remote\ debug">
                <title>Deploy with Remote Debug</title>
                <paragraph>When this option is enabled, using one-click deploy will make the executable
                    attempt to connect to this computer's IP so the running project can be debugged.
                    This option is intended to be used for remote debugging (typically with a mobile
                    device).
                    You don't need to enable it to use the GDScript debugger locally.</paragraph>

                <title>Small Deploy with Network Filesystem</title>
                <paragraph>This option speeds up testing for games with a large footprint on remote devices.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>When <strong>Small Deploy with Network Filesystem</strong> is on, instead of exporting the
                    full game, deploying the game builds a minimal executable. The editor then
                    provides files from the project over the network.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Also, on Android, the game is deployed using the USB cable to speed up
                    deployment.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>When this option is enabled, avoidance object shapes, radiuses, and velocities
                    will be visible in the running project.</paragraph>

                <title>Debug CanvasItem Redraws</title>
                <paragraph>When this option is enabled, redraw requests of 2D objects will become visible
                    (as a short flash) in the running project.
                    This is useful to troubleshoot low processor mode.</paragraph>

                <title>Synchronize Scene Changes</title>
                <paragraph>When this option is enabled, any changes made to the scene in the editor will be
                    replicated in the running project.
                    When used remotely on a device, this is more efficient when the network
                    filesystem option is enabled.</paragraph>

                    be reloaded in the running project. When used
                    remotely on a device, this is more efficient with the network filesystem.</paragraph>

                <title>Customize Run Instances...</title>
                <paragraph>This opens a dialog allowing you to tell Godot to run multiple instances of the
                    game at once, and to specify the command line arguments for each instance. This
                    is especially useful when building and debugging multiplayer games.</paragraph>

            <title>Script editor debug tools and options</title>
            <paragraph>The script editor has its own set of debug tools for use with breakpoints and
                two options. The breakpoint tools can also be found in the <strong>Debugger</strong> tab
                of the debugger.</paragraph>
            <tip>
                <paragraph>You can create a breakpoint by clicking the gutter in the left of the script
                    editor (on the left of the line numbers). When hovering this gutter, you
                    will see a transparent red dot appearing, which turns into an opaque red dot
                    after the breakpoint is placed by clicking. Click the red dot again to
                    remove the breakpoint. Breakpoints created this way persist across editor
                    restarts, even if the script wasn't saved when exiting the editor.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>You can also use the <literal>breakpoint</literal> keyword in GDScript to create a
                    breakpoint that is stored in the script itself. Unlike breakpoints created by
                    clicking in the gutter, this keyword-based breakpoint is persistent across
                    different machines when using version control.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The <strong>Break</strong> button causes a break in the script like a breakpoint would.
                <strong>Continue</strong> makes the game continue after pausing at a breakpoint.
                <strong>Step Over</strong> goes to the next line of code, and <strong>Step Into</strong> goes into
                a function if possible. Otherwise, it does the same thing as <strong>Step Over</strong>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The <strong>Debug with External Editor</strong> option lets you debug your game with an external editor.
                You can set a shortcut for it in <strong>Editor Settings &gt; Shortcuts &gt; Debugger</strong>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>When the debugger breaks on a breakpoint, a green triangle arrow is visible in
                the script editor's gutter. This arrow indicates the line of code the debugger
                broke on.</paragraph>
