            <paragraph>This page provides a brief introduction to C#, both what it is and
                how to use it in Godot. Afterwards, you may want to look at
                <reference internal="True" refuri="c_sharp_features#doc-c-sharp-features"><inline classes="std std-ref">how to use specific features</inline></reference>, read about the

                step-by-step tutorial.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>C# is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft. In Godot,
                it is implemented with the modern .NET runtime.</paragraph>
            <attention>
                <paragraph>Projects written in C# using Godot 4 currently cannot be exported to the web
                    platform. To use C# on the web platform, consider Godot 3 instead.
                    Android and iOS platform support is available as of Godot 4.2, but is
                    experimental and <reference internal="True" refuri="index#doc-c-sharp-platforms"><inline classes="std std-ref">some limitations apply</inline></reference>.</paragraph>
            </attention>
            <note>
                <paragraph>This is <strong>not</strong> a full-scale tutorial on the C# language as a whole.
                    If you aren't already familiar with its syntax or features, see the
                    <reference name="Microsoft C# guide" refuri="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/index">Microsoft C# guide</reference><target ids="microsoft-c-guide" names="microsoft\ c#\ guide" refuri="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/index"></target>

            <paragraph>Godot bundles the parts of .NET needed to run already-compiled games.
                However, Godot does not bundle the tools required to build and compile
                games, such as MSBuild and the C# compiler. These are
                included in the .NET SDK, and need to be installed separately.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In summary, you must have installed the .NET SDK <strong>and</strong> the .NET-enabled
                version of Godot.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Download and install the latest stable version of the SDK from the
                <reference name=".NET download page" refuri="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">.NET download page</reference>.
                Godot 4.5 requires .NET 8 or later, but exporting to Android requires .NET 9 or later.</paragraph>
            <important>
                <paragraph>Be sure to install the 64-bit version of the SDK(s)
                    if you are using the 64-bit version of Godot.</paragraph>
            </important>
            <paragraph>If you are building Godot from source, make sure to follow the steps to enable
                .NET support in your build as outlined in the <reference internal="True" refuri="../../../engine_details/development/compiling/compiling_with_dotnet#doc-compiling-with-dotnet"><inline classes="std std-ref">Compiling with .NET</inline></reference>

            <title>Configuring an external editor</title>
            <paragraph>C# support in Godot's built-in script editor is minimal. Consider using an
                external IDE or editor, such as  <reference name="Visual Studio Code" refuri="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</reference>
                or <reference name="Visual Studio" refuri="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</reference>. These provide autocompletion, debugging, and other
                useful features for C#. To select an external editor in Godot,
                click on <strong>Editor → Editor Settings</strong> and scroll down to
                <strong>Dotnet</strong>. Under <strong>Dotnet</strong>, click on <strong>Editor</strong>, and select your
                external editor of choice. Godot currently supports the following
                external editors:</paragraph>

                <paragraph>To debug your C# scripts using Visual Studio, open the .sln file that is generated
                    after opening the first C# script in the editor. In the <strong>Debug</strong> menu, go to the
                    <strong>Debug Properties</strong> menu item for your project. Click the <strong>Create a new profile</strong>
                    button and choose <strong>Executable</strong>. In the <strong>Executable</strong> field, browse to the path
                    of the C# version of the Godot editor, or type <literal>%GODOT4%</literal> if you have created an
                    environment variable for the Godot executable path. It must be the path to the main Godot
                    executable, not the 'console' version. For the <strong>Working Directory</strong>, type a single period,
                    <literal>.</literal>, meaning the current directory. Also check the <strong>Enable native code debugging</strong>
                    checkbox. You may now close this window, click downward arrow on the debug profile
                    dropdown, and select your new launch profile. Hit the green start button, and your
                    game will begin playing in debug mode.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>As C# support is quite new in Godot, there are some growing pains and things
                that need to be ironed out. Below is a list of the most important issues
                you should be aware of when diving into C# in Godot, but if in doubt, also
                take a look over the official

                    <paragraph>State is currently not saved and restored when hot-reloading,
                        with the exception of exported variables.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Attached C# scripts should refer to a class that has a class name
                        that matches the file name.</paragraph>

                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>There are some methods such as <literal>Get()</literal>/<literal>Set()</literal>, <literal>Call()</literal>/<literal>CallDeferred()</literal>
                        and signal connection method <literal>Connect()</literal> that rely on Godot's <literal>snake_case</literal> API
                        naming conventions.
                        So when using e.g. <literal>CallDeferred("AddChild")</literal>, <literal>AddChild</literal> will not work because
                        the API is expecting the original <literal>snake_case</literal> version <literal>add_child</literal>. However, you
                        can use any custom properties or methods without this limitation.
                        Prefer using the exposed <literal>StringName</literal> in the <literal>PropertyName</literal>, <literal>MethodName</literal> and
                        <literal>SignalName</literal> to avoid extra <literal>StringName</literal> allocations and worrying about snake_case naming.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>As of Godot 4.0, exporting .NET projects is supported for desktop platforms
                (Linux, Windows and macOS). Other platforms will gain support in future 4.x
                releases.</paragraph>

            <title>Common pitfalls</title>
            <paragraph>You might encounter the following error when trying to modify some values in Godot
                objects, e.g. when trying to change the X coordinate of a <literal>Node2D</literal>:</paragraph>
            <literal_block force="False" highlight_args="{'hl_lines': [5]}" language="csharp" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">public partial class MyNode2D : Node2D
{
    public override void _Ready()
    {
        Position.X = 100.0f;
        // CS1612: Cannot modify the return value of 'Node2D.Position' because
        // it is not a variable.
    }
}</literal_block>
            <paragraph>This is perfectly normal. Structs (in this example, a <literal>Vector2</literal>) in C# are
                copied on assignment, meaning that when you retrieve such an object from a
                property or an indexer, you get a copy of it, not the object itself. Modifying
                said copy without reassigning it afterwards won't achieve anything.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The workaround is simple: retrieve the entire struct, modify the value you want
                to modify, and reassign the property.</paragraph>
            <literal_block force="False" highlight_args="{}" language="csharp" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">var newPosition = Position;
newPosition.X = 100.0f;
Position = newPosition;</literal_block>
            <paragraph>Since C# 10, it is also possible to use <reference name="with expressions" refuri="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/with-expression">with expressions</reference><target ids="with-expressions" names="with\ expressions" refuri="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/with-expression"></target>
                on structs, allowing you to do the same thing in a single line.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Most properties of Godot C# objects that are based on <literal>GodotObject</literal>
                (e.g. any <literal>Node</literal> like <literal>Control</literal> or <literal>Node3D</literal> like <literal>Camera3D</literal>) require native (interop) calls as they talk to
                Godot's C++ core.
                Consider assigning values of such properties into a local variable if you need to modify or read them multiple times at
                a single code location:</paragraph>
            <literal_block force="False" highlight_args="{}" language="csharp" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">using Godot;

public partial class YourCustomClass : Node3D
{
    private void ExpensiveReposition()
    {
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        {
            // Position is read and set 10 times which incurs native interop.
            // Furthermore the object is repositioned 10 times in 3D space which
            // takes additional time.
            Position += new Vector3(i, i);
        }
    }

    private void Reposition()
    {
        // A variable is used to avoid native interop for Position on every loop.
        var newPosition = Position;
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        {
            newPosition += new Vector3(i, i);
        }
        // Setting Position only once avoids native interop and repositioning in 3D space.
        Position = newPosition;
    }
}</literal_block>
            <paragraph>Passing raw arrays (such as <literal>byte[]</literal>) or <literal>string</literal> to Godot's C# API requires marshalling which is
                comparatively pricey.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The implicit conversion from <literal>string</literal> to <literal>NodePath</literal> or <literal>StringName</literal> incur both the native interop and marshalling
                costs as the <literal>string</literal> has to be marshalled and passed to the respective native constructor.</paragraph>

                They can also be added manually by adding the package reference in
                the <literal>.csproj</literal> file located in the project root:</paragraph>
