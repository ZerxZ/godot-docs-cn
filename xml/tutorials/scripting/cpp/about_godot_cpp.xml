            as part of the Godot project.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>godot-cpp is built with the <reference internal="True" refuri="../gdextension/index#doc-gdextension"><inline classes="std std-ref">GDExtension system</inline></reference>, which allows access to Godot in almost the
            same way as <reference internal="True" refuri="../../../engine_details/architecture/custom_modules_in_cpp#doc-custom-modules-in-cpp"><inline classes="std std-ref">modules</inline></reference>: A lot of <reference name="engine code" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot">engine code</reference>
            can be used in your godot-cpp project almost exactly as it is.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In particular, godot-cpp has access to all functions that <reference internal="True" refuri="../gdscript/index#doc-gdscript"><inline classes="std std-ref">GDScript</inline></reference> and <reference internal="True" refuri="../c_sharp/index#doc-c-sharp"><inline classes="std std-ref">C#</inline></reference>
            have, and additional access to a few more for fast low-level access of data, or deeper integration with Godot.</paragraph>

            <title>Differences between godot-cpp and C++ modules</title>

            <paragraph>They also both allow you to integrate third-party libraries into Godot. The one
                you should choose depends on your needs.</paragraph>

                <title>Advantages of godot-cpp</title>
                <paragraph>Unlike modules, godot-cpp (and GDExtensions, in general) don't require
                    compiling the engine's source code, making it easier to distribute your work.
                    It gives you access to most of the API available to GDScript and C#, allowing
                    you to code game logic with full control regarding performance. It's ideal if
                    you need high-performance code you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the

                            project. With C++ modules, you have to recompile all the export templates you

                        <paragraph>godot-cpp only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine.
                            That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine.
                            Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with
                            incremental builds, this process is slower than using godot-cpp.</paragraph>

            <title>Version compatibility</title>
            <paragraph>GDExtensions targeting an earlier version of Godot should work in later
                minor versions, but not vice-versa. For example, a GDExtension targeting Godot 4.2
                should work just fine in Godot 4.3, but one targeting Godot 4.3 won't work in Godot 4.2.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For this reason, when creating GDExtensions, you may want to target the lowest version of
                Godot that has the features you need, <emphasis>not</emphasis> the most recent version of Godot. This can
                save you from needing to create multiple builds for different versions of Godot.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>There is one exception to this: extensions targeting Godot 4.0 will <strong>not</strong> work with
                Godot 4.1 and later (see <reference internal="True" refuri="../../migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.1#updating-your-gdextension-for-godot-4-1"><inline classes="std std-ref">Updating your GDExtension for 4.1</inline></reference>).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>GDExtensions are also only compatible with engine builds that use the same
                level of floating-point precision the extension was compiled for. This means
                that if you use an engine build with double-precision floats, the extension must
                also be compiled for double-precision floats and use an <literal>extension_api.json</literal>
                file generated by your custom engine build. See <reference internal="True" refuri="../../physics/large_world_coordinates#doc-large-world-coordinates"><inline classes="std std-ref">Large world coordinates</inline></reference>
                for details.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Generally speaking, if you build a custom version of Godot, you should generate an
                <literal>extension_api.json</literal> from it for your GDExtensions, because it may have some differences
                from official Godot builds. You can learn more about the process of using custom
                <literal>extension_api.json</literal> files in the <reference internal="True" refuri="build_system/scons#doc-godot-cpp-build-system"><inline classes="std std-ref">build system section</inline></reference>.</paragraph>
