        <title>How to read the Godot API</title>
        <paragraph>On this page, you'll learn how to read the class reference for the Godot API.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The API, or Application Programming Interface, is an index of what Godot offers
            users. It provides a brief summary of which classes exist, how they are
            related to each other, what features they have, and how to use them.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>At the top of each file, you will see the name of the class.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The "Inherits" section lists each class the current one inherits.
                Here <literal>CanvasItem</literal> inherits <literal>Node</literal> and <literal>Node</literal> inherits <literal>Object</literal>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The "Inherited By" section lists each class which directly inherits the
                current class. Here <literal>Control</literal> and <literal>Node2D</literal> both inherit <literal>CanvasItem</literal>.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The Properties table lists the variables which belong to each instance of the
                class, also known as the "properties."</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The left column contains the data type of the property. The text is also a

            <paragraph>The center column contains the name of the property. The text is also a link
                to that property's full description on the page. Use this name to get the
                property's data or set a new value to it.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The right column contains the default value of the property. To initialize it
                with a different value, you must set a different value via script or the

            <paragraph>The right column contains the name, parameters, and qualifiers of the method.
                The name is the text before the opening parenthesis. It is also a link to the
                method's full description on the page. Use this name to call the method.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For each parameter, the page details its data type, name, and default value,

            <paragraph>The Signals list details the names and parameters of events which "signal" a
                change in game state to other class instances.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Like the Methods table, any parameters will include their data type and name.</paragraph>

                current class.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For each enumeration, the page states its name and then lists its possible
                values.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For each enumeration value, the page states its name, its integer value, and
                an explanation of its use case(s) and/or affects.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The Property Descriptions list details everything about each property.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>It restates the data type and name of the property.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Every property in the Godot API is bound to a pair of setter and getter
                functions. Using either is equivalent. They are listed here.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Below that is a detailed summary of what the property's data represents, its
                use case(s) and/or the affects of changing it. It may include code samples
                and/or links to relevant parts of the Godot API.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>Knowing the setter and getter names is useful when one must bind a
                    method name or <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_callable#class-callable"><inline classes="std std-ref">Callable</inline></reference> to something.</paragraph>
