            <title>What is one-click deploy?</title>
            <paragraph>One-click deploy is a feature that is available once a platform is properly
                configured and a supported device is connected to the computer. Since things can
                go wrong at many levels (platform may not be configured correctly, SDK may be
                incorrectly installed, device may be improperly configured, etc.), it's good to
                let the user know that it exists.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>After adding an Android export preset marked as Runnable, Godot can detect when
                a USB device is connected to the computer and offer the user to automatically
                export, install and run the project (in debug mode) on the device. This feature
                is called <emphasis>one-click deploy</emphasis>.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>One-click deploy is only available once you've added an export template
                    marked as <strong>Runnable</strong> in the Export dialog. You can mark several export
                    presets as runnable, but only one preset per platform may be marked as
                    runnable. If you mark a second preset in a given platform as runnable, the
                    other preset will no longer be marked as runnable.</paragraph>

                <title>Web</title>
                <paragraph>By default, the web server started by the editor is only accessible from
                    <literal>localhost</literal>. This means the web server can't be reached by other devices on
                    the local network or the Internet (if port forwarding is set up on the router).
                    This is done for security reasons, as you may not want other devices to be able
                    to access the exported project while you're testing it. Binding to <literal>localhost</literal>
                    also prevents a firewall popup from appearing when you use one-click deploy for
                    the web platform.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>To make the local web server accessible over the local network, you'll need to
                    change the <strong>Export &gt; Web &gt; HTTP Host</strong> editor setting to <literal>0.0.0.0</literal>. You will
                    also need to enable <strong>Export &gt; Web &gt; Use TLS</strong> as SharedArrayBuffer requires the
                    use of a secure connection to work, <emphasis>unless</emphasis> connecting to <literal>localhost</literal>.
                    However, since other clients will be connecting to a remote device, the use of
                    TLS is absolutely required here.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>To make the local web server accessible over the Internet, you'll also need to
                    forward the <strong>Export &gt; Web &gt; HTTP Port</strong> port specified in the Editor Settings
                    (<literal>8060</literal> by default) in TCP on your router. This is usually done by accessing
                    your router's web interface then adding a NAT rule for the port in question. For
                    IPv6 connections, you should allow the port in the router's IPv6 firewall
                    instead. Like for local network devices, you will also need to enable <strong>Export &gt;
                        Web &gt; Use TLS</strong>.</paragraph>
                <note>
                    <paragraph>When <strong>Use TLS</strong> is enabled, you will get a warning from your web browser as
                        Godot will use a temporary self-signed certificate. You can safely ignore it
                        and bypass the warning by clicking <strong>Advanced</strong> and then <strong>Proceed to
                            (address)</strong>.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>If you have an SSL/TLS certificate that is trusted by browsers, you can specify
                        the paths to the key and certificate files in the <strong>Export &gt; Web &gt; TLS Key</strong>
                        and <strong>Export &gt; Web &gt; TLS Certificate</strong>. This will only work if the project
                        is accessed through a domain name that is part of the TLS certificate.</paragraph>
                </note>
                <warning>
                    <paragraph>When using one-click deploy on different projects, it's possible that
                        a previously edited project is being shown instead. This is due to service
                        worker caching not being cleared automatically. See
                        <reference internal="True" refuri="exporting_for_web#doc-exporting-for-web-troubleshooting"><inline classes="std std-ref">Troubleshooting</inline></reference> for instructions on unregistering
                        the service worker, which will effectively clear the cache and resolve the issue.</paragraph>
