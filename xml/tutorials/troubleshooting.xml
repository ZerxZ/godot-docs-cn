            <title>The editor runs slowly and uses all my CPU and GPU resources, making my computer noisy</title>
            <paragraph>This is a known issue, especially on macOS since most Macs have Retina displays.
                Due to Retina displays' higher pixel density, everything has to be rendered at a
                higher resolution. This increases the load on the GPU and decreases perceived
                performance.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>There are several ways to improve performance and battery life:</paragraph>

                        <strong>Half Resolution</strong>. The 3D viewport will now be rendered at half resolution,
                        which can be up to 4 times faster.</paragraph>

                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Open the Editor Settings and increase the value of <strong>Low Processor Mode Sleep (µsec)</strong>
                        to <literal>33000</literal> (30 FPS). This value determines the amount of <emphasis>microseconds</emphasis>
                        between frames to render. Higher values will make the editor feel less reactive,
                        but will help decrease CPU and GPU usage significantly.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>If you have a node that causes the editor to redraw continuously (such as

                        This way, it will be hidden in the editor, but will still be visible in the
                        running project.</paragraph>

            <title>The editor stutters and flickers on my variable refresh rate monitor (G-Sync/FreeSync)</title>
            <paragraph>This is a <reference name="known issue" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/38219">known issue</reference>.
                Variable refresh rate monitors need to adjust their gamma curves continuously to
                emit a consistent amount of light over time. This can cause flicker to appear in
                dark areas of the image when the refresh rate varies a lot, which occurs as
                the Godot editor only redraws when necessary.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>There are several workarounds for this:</paragraph>
            <bullet_list bullet="-">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Enable <strong>Interface &gt; Editor &gt; Update Continuously</strong> in the Editor Settings. Keep in mind
                        this will increase power usage and heat/noise emissions since the editor will
                        now be rendering constantly, even if nothing has changed on screen. To
                        alleviate this, you can increase <strong>Low Processor Mode Sleep (µsec)</strong> to
                        <literal>33000</literal> (30 FPS) in the Editor Settings. This value determines the amount of
                        <emphasis>microseconds</emphasis> between frames to render. Higher values will make the editor
                        feel less reactive, but will help decrease CPU and GPU usage significantly.</paragraph>

                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Alternatively, disable variable refresh rate on your monitor or in the graphics driver.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>VRR flicker can be reduced on some displays using the <strong>VRR Control</strong> or
                        <strong>Fine Tune Dark Areas</strong> options in your monitor's OSD. These options may
                        increase input lag or result in crushed blacks.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>If using an OLED display, use the <strong>Black (OLED)</strong> editor theme preset in the
                        Editor Settings. This hides VRR flicker thanks to OLED's perfect black levels.</paragraph>

            <title>The editor or project takes a very long time to start</title>
            <paragraph>When using one of the RenderingDevice-based renderers (Forward+ or Mobile), the first
                startup is expected to be relatively long. This is because shaders
                need to be compiled before they can be cached. Shaders also need to be cached
                again after updating Godot, after updating graphics drivers or after switching
                graphics cards.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If the issue persists after the first startup, this is a
                <reference name="known bug" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20566">known bug</reference> on
                Windows when you have specific USB peripherals connected. In particular,
                Corsair's iCUE software seems to cause this bug. Try updating your USB
                peripherals' drivers to their latest version. If the bug persists, you need to
                disconnect the specific peripheral before opening the editor. You can then
                connect the peripheral again.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Firewall software such as Portmaster may also cause the debug port to be
                blocked. This causes the project to take a long time to start, while being
                unable to use debugging features in the editor (such as viewing <literal>print()</literal>
                output). You can work this around by changing the debug port used by the project
                in the Editor Settings (<strong>Network &gt; Debug &gt; Remote Port</strong>). The default is
                <literal>6007</literal>; try another value that is greater than <literal>1024</literal>, such as <literal>7007</literal>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>On Windows, when loading the project for the first time after the PC is turned on,
                Windows Defender will cause the filesystem cache validation on project startup
                to take significantly longer. This is especially noticeable in projects with a
                large number of files. Consinder adding the project folder to the list of exclusions
                by going to Virus &amp; threat protection &gt; Virus &amp; threat protection settings &gt;
                Add or remove exclusions.</paragraph>

            <title>The Godot editor appears frozen after clicking the system console</title>
            <paragraph>When running Godot on Windows with the system console enabled, you can
                accidentally enable <emphasis>selection mode</emphasis> by clicking inside the command window. This
                Windows-specific behavior pauses the application to let you select text inside
                the system console. Godot cannot override this system-specific behavior.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To solve this, select the system console window and press Enter to leave
                selection mode.</paragraph>

            <title>The Godot editor's macOS dock icon gets duplicated every time it is manually moved</title>
            <paragraph>If you open the Godot editor and manually change the position of the dock icon,
                then restart the editor, you will get a duplicate dock icon all the way to the
                right of the dock.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This is due to a design limitation of the macOS dock. The only known way to
                resolve this would be to merge the project manager and editor into a single
                process, which means the project manager would no longer spawn a separate
                process when starting the editor. While using a single process instance would
                bring several benefits, it isn't planned to be done in the near future due to
                the complexity of the task.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To avoid this issue, keep the Godot editor's dock icon at its default location
                as created by macOS.</paragraph>

            <title>A microphone or "refresh" icon appears in the bottom-right corner of the Project Manager and editor window</title>
            <paragraph>This is caused by the NVIDIA graphics driver injecting an overlay to display
                instant replay information on ShadowPlay recording. This overlay can only be
                seen on Windows, as Linux does not have support for ShadowPlay.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To disable this overlay, press <literal classes="kbd">Alt + Z</literal> (default shortcut for the NVIDIA overlay)
                and disable <strong>Settings &gt; HUD Layout &gt; Status Indicator</strong> in the NVIDIA overlay.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Alternatively, you can install the <title_reference>new NVIDIA app
                    &lt;https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/&gt;</title_reference> which replaces GeForce
                Experience and does not suffer from this issue. Unlike GeForce Experience, the
                NVIDIA app draws the replay indicator in the corner of the screen as opposed to
                the corner of each window.</paragraph>

                it is recommended to disable HDR in the Windows settings when not running applications

                It is also strongly recommended to use Windows 11 instead of Windows 10 when using HDR.

            <title>The editor/project freezes or displays glitched visuals after resuming the PC from suspend</title>
            <paragraph>This is a known issue on Linux with NVIDIA graphics when using the proprietary
                driver. There is no definitive fix yet, as suspend on Linux + NVIDIA is often
                buggy when OpenGL or Vulkan is involved. The Compatibility rendering method
                (which uses OpenGL) is generally less prone to suspend-related issues compared
                to the Forward+ and Mobile renderers (which use Vulkan).</paragraph>

                into the PCK file. Some files commonly used, such as JSON files, are not
                considered resources. For example, if you load <literal>test.json</literal> in the exported
                project, you need to specify <literal>*.json</literal> in the non-resource export filter. See
                <reference internal="True" refuri="export/exporting_projects#doc-exporting-projects-export-mode"><inline classes="std std-ref">Resource options</inline></reference> for more information.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Also, note that files and folders whose names begin with a period will never be
                included in the exported project. This is done to prevent version control
                folders like <literal>.git</literal> from being included in the exported PCK file.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>On Windows, this can also be due to <reference internal="True" refuri="best_practices/project_organization#doc-project-organization-case-sensitivity"><inline classes="std std-ref">case sensitivity</inline></reference> issues. If you reference a resource
                in your script with a different case than on the filesystem, loading will fail
                once you export the project. This is because the virtual PCK filesystem is
                case-sensitive, while Windows's filesystem is case-insensitive by default.</paragraph>

            <title>The project crashes frequently or instantly after opening it from the project manager</title>
            <paragraph>This could be caused by a number of things such as an editor plugin, GDExtension
                addon, or something else. In this scenario it's recommended that you open the
                project in recovery mode, and attempt to find and fix whatever is causing the
                crashes. See the <reference internal="True" refuri="editor/project_manager#doc-project-manager"><inline classes="std std-ref">Project Manager page</inline></reference> for more
                information.</paragraph>
