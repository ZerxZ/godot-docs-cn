                    <paragraph><strong>Forward+</strong>. The most advanced renderer, suited for desktop platforms only.
                        Used by default on desktop platforms. This renderer uses <strong>Vulkan</strong>, <strong>Direct3D 12</strong>,
                        or <strong>Metal</strong> as the rendering driver, and it uses the <strong>RenderingDevice</strong> backend.</paragraph>

                <list_item>
                    <paragraph><strong>Mobile</strong>. Fewer features, but renders simple scenes faster. Suited for mobile
                        and desktop platforms. Used by default on mobile platforms. This renderer uses
                        <strong>Vulkan</strong>, <strong>Direct3D 12</strong>, or <strong>Metal</strong> as the rendering driver, and it uses
                        the <strong>RenderingDevice</strong> backend.</paragraph>

                <list_item>
                    <paragraph><strong>Compatibility</strong>, sometimes called <strong>GL Compatibility</strong>. The least advanced
                        renderer, suited for low-end desktop and mobile platforms. Used by default on
                        the web platform. This renderer uses <strong>OpenGL</strong> as the rendering driver.</paragraph>

                </figure>
                <paragraph>The <emphasis>renderer</emphasis>, or <emphasis>rendering method</emphasis>, determines which features are available.
                    Most of the time, this is the only thing you need to think about. Godot's renderers
                    are <strong>Forward+</strong>, <strong>Mobile</strong>, and <strong>Compatibility</strong>.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The <emphasis>rendering driver</emphasis> tells the GPU what to do, using a graphics API. Godot can
                    use the <strong>OpenGL</strong>, <strong>Vulkan</strong>, <strong>Direct3D 12</strong>, and <strong>Metal</strong> rendering drivers.
                    Not every GPU supports every rendering driver, and therefore not every GPU supports
                    all renderers. Vulkan, Direct3D 12, and Metal are modern, low-level graphics APIs,
                    and requires newer hardware. OpenGL is an older graphics API that runs on most hardware.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>RenderingDevice is a <emphasis>rendering backend</emphasis>, an abstraction layer between the renderer
                    and the rendering driver. It is used by the Forward+ and Mobile renderers, and
                    these renderers are sometimes called "RenderingDevice-based renderers".</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Keep in mind every game is unique, and this is only a starting point. For example,
                you might choose to use the Compatibility renderer even though you have the latest
                GPU, so you can support the widest range of hardware. Or you might want to use the
                Forward+ renderer for a 2D game, so you can advanced features like compute shaders.</paragraph>

                <title>Switching between renderers</title>
                <paragraph>In the editor, you can always switch between renderers by clicking on the renderer
                    name in the upper-right corner of the editor.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Switching between renderers may require some manual tweaks to your scene, lighting,
                    and environment, since each renderer is different. In general, switching between
                    the Mobile and Forward+ renderers will require fewer adjustments than switching
                    between the Compatibility renderer and the Forward+ or Mobile renderers.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Since Godot 4.4, when using Forward+ or Mobile, if Vulkan is not supported, the
                    engine will fall back to Direct3D 12 and vice versa. If the attempted fallback
                    driver is not supported either, the engine will then fall back to Compatibility
                    when the RenderingDevice backend is not supported. This allows the project to run
                    anyway, but it may look different than the intended appearance due to the more
                    limited renderer. This behavior can be disabled in the project settings by unchecking
