            <title>Games and internationalization</title>
            <paragraph>The gaming community isn't monolingual or monocultural. It's made up of
                many different languages and cultures - just like the Godot community!
                If you want to allow players to experience your game in their language,
                one of things you'll need to provide is text translations, which Godot
                supports via internationalized text.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In regular desktop or mobile applications, internationalized text is
                usually located in resource files (or .po files for GNU stuff). Games,
                however, can use several orders of magnitude more text than
                applications, so they must support efficient methods for dealing with
                loads of multilingual text.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>There are two approaches to generate multilingual language games and
                applications. Both are based on a key:value system. The first is to use
                one of the languages as the key (usually English), the second is to use a
                specific identifier. The first approach is probably easier for
                development if a game is released first in English, later in other
                languages, but a complete nightmare if working with many languages at
                the same time.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In general, games use the second approach and a unique ID is used for
                each string. This allows you to revise the text while it is being
                translated to other languages. The unique ID can be a number, a string,
                or a string with a number (it's just a unique string anyway).</paragraph>

        <section ids="supported-formats" names="supported\ formats">
            <title>Supported formats</title>
            <paragraph>To complete the picture and allow efficient support for translations,
                Godot has a special importer that can read CSV files. Most spreadsheet
                editors can export to this format, so the only requirement is that the
                files have a special arrangement. See
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../i18n/localization_using_spreadsheets#doc-localization-using-spreadsheets"><inline classes="std std-ref">Localization using spreadsheets</inline></reference> for detailed info on
                formatting and importing CSVs.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If you need a more powerful file format, Godot also supports loading
                translations written in the gettext <literal>.po</literal> format. See
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../i18n/localization_using_gettext#doc-localization-using-gettext"><inline classes="std std-ref">Localization using gettext (PO files)</inline></reference> for details.</paragraph>
