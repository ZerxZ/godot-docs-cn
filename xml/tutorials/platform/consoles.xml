            <title>Console porting process</title>
            <paragraph>In order to develop for consoles in Godot, you need access to the console SDK and
                export templates for it. These export templates need to be developed either by
                yourself or someone hired to do it, or provided by a third-party company.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Currently, the only console Godot officially supports is Steam Deck (through the
                official Linux export templates).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The reasons other consoles are not officially supported are the risks of legal
                liability, disproportionate cost, and open source licensing issues. The reasons
                are explained in more detail in this article <reference name="About Official Console Ports" refuri="https://godotengine.org/article/about-official-console-ports/">About Official Console Ports</reference></paragraph>
            <paragraph>As explained, however, it is possible to port your games to consoles thanks to
                services provided by third-party companies.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine. In other
                    words, there is no engine that is legally allowed to distribute console export
                    templates without requiring the user to prove that they are a licensed console
                    developer.</paragraph>

            <title>Console publishing process</title>
            <paragraph>Regardless of the engine used to create the game, the process to publish a game
                to a console platform is as follows:</paragraph>
            <bullet_list bullet="-">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Register a developer account on the console manufacturer's website, then sign
                        NDAs and publishing contracts. This requires you to have a registered legal
                        entity.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. This
                        can take up to several months. Note that this step is significantly easier if
                        an established publisher is backing your game. Nintendo is generally known to
                        be more accepting of smaller developers, but this is not guaranteed.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Get access to developer tools and order a console specially made for
                        developers (<emphasis>devkit</emphasis>). The cost of those devkits is confidential.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Port your game to the console platform or pay a company to do it.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>To be published, your game needs to be rated in the regions you'd like to sell
                        it in. For example, game ratings are handled by <reference name="ESRB" refuri="https://www.esrb.org/">ESRB</reference>
                        in North America, and <reference name="PEGI" refuri="https://pegi.info/">PEGI</reference> in Europe. Indie developers
                        can generally get a rating for cheaper compared to more established developers.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
            </bullet_list>
            <paragraph>Due to the complexity of the process, many studios and developers prefer to
                outsource console porting.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Middleware ports are available through the console vendor's website. They
