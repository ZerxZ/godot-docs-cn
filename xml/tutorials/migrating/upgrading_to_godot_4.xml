                <paragraph><strong>Since Godot 4 is a complete rewrite in many aspects, some features have

                            projects that used the default physics engine (which was Bullet) and didn't
                            manually change it to GodotPhysics. There are no plans to re-add Bullet physics
                            in core, but a third-party add-on could be created for it thanks to

                            renderers, Viewports cannot return HDR data anymore. This is planned to be

                            platforms is still supported, and as of 4.2 there's experimental support for
                            exporting to mobile platforms. Support for exporting C# projects to more
                            platforms will be restored in future 4.x releases as upstream support

            <paragraph>If you want to be ready to upgrade to Godot 4 in the future, consider using
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_tweener#class-tweener"><inline classes="std std-ref">Tweener</inline></reference> and the <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_time#class-time"><inline classes="std std-ref">Time</inline></reference> singleton in your project. These
                classes are both available in Godot 3.5 and later.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This way, you won't be relying on the deprecated Tween node and OS time
                functions, both of which are removed in Godot 4.0.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>It's also a good idea to rename external shaders so that their extension is
                <literal>.gdshader</literal> instead of <literal>.shader</literal>. Godot 3.x supports both extensions, but
                only <literal>.gdshader</literal> is supported in Godot 4.0.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Due to how the project upgrade tool works, not all
                    <abbreviation explanation="Application Programming Interface">API</abbreviation> renames can be performed automatically.
                    The list below contains all renames that must be performed manually using the script editor.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If you cannot find a node or resource in the list below, refer to the above
                    table to find its new name.</paragraph>
                <tip>
                    <paragraph>You can use the <strong>Replace in Files</strong> dialog to speed up replacement by pressing
                        <literal classes="kbd">Ctrl + Shift + R</literal> while the script editor is open. However, be careful
                        as the Replace in Files dialog doesn't offer any way to undo a replacement.
                        Use version control to commit your upgrade work regularly.
                        Command line tools such as <reference name="sd" refuri="https://github.com/chmln/sd">sd</reference> can also be used
                        if you need something more flexible than the editor's Replace in Files dialog.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>If using C#, remember to search for outdated API usage with PascalCase
                        notation in the project (and perform the replacement with PascalCase
                        notation).</paragraph>
