        <paragraph>Godot <reference internal="True" refuri="../../about/release_policy#doc-release-policy"><inline classes="std std-ref">loosely follows</inline></reference> a semantic versioning system,
            where compatibility is assumed between minor and patch releases, while major
            releases can break it. As such, it is generally not recommended to move projects
            between major versions during their development, especially if you've been
            working on them for a significant amount of time.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Still, new features, usability improvements, or paradigm shifts in engine's
            internals may incentivize you to upgrade. Below is a list of articles that should
            assist you when upgrading your project between versions. Each article would try
            its best to document every important difference and provide you with a migration
            path.</paragraph>
