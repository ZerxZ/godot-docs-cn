        <title>Using the theme editor</title>
        <paragraph>This article explains how to create and manage UI themes using the Godot
            editor and its theme editor tool. We recommend getting familiar with the
            basics behind GUI skinning/theming by reading <reference internal="True" refuri="gui_skinning#doc-gui-skinning"><inline classes="std std-ref">Introduction to GUI skinning</inline></reference> before starting.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The theme editor is a bottom panel tool that activates automatically, when
            a <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_theme#class-theme"><inline classes="std std-ref">Theme</inline></reference> resource is selected for editing. It contains
            the necessary UI for adding, removing, and adjusting theme types and theme
            items. It features a preview section for testing your changes live, as well
            as a window dialog for doing bulk operations of the theme items.</paragraph>
        <section ids="creating-a-theme" names="creating\ a\ theme">
            <title>Creating a theme</title>
            <paragraph>Like any other resources, themes can be created directly in the file system dock
                by right-clicking and selecting <strong>New Resource...</strong>, then selecting <strong>Theme</strong>
                and clicking <strong>Create</strong>. This is especially useful for creating project-wide
                themes.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Themes also can be created from any control node. Select a control node in the scene
                hierarchy, then in the inspector go to the <literal>theme</literal> property. From there you can
                select <strong>New Theme</strong>.</paragraph>
            <figure align="center">
                <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/ui/img/new_theme.webp'}" original_uri="img/new_theme.webp" uri="tutorials/ui/img/new_theme.webp"></image>
            </figure>
            <paragraph>This will create an empty theme and open up the theme editor. Keep in mind that
                resources created this way are bundled with the scene by default. Use the context
                menu to save the new theme to a file instead.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>While the theme editor provides the tools to manage theme types and items, themes also
                include the default, fallback font that you can edit only using the Inspector dock.
                Same applies to the contents of complex resource types, such as <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_stylebox#class-stylebox"><inline classes="std std-ref">StyleBoxes</inline></reference>
                and icons — they open for editing in the Inspector.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The theme editor has two main parts. The main theme editor, located at the bottom of
                the Godot editor, aims to provide users with tools to quickly create, edit, and delete
                theme items and types. It gives visual tools for picking and changing controls, abstracting
                the underlying theme concepts. The <strong>Manage Theme Items</strong> dialog, on the other hand,
                tries to address the needs of those who want to change themes manually. It's also
                useful for creating a new editor theme.</paragraph>

                <title>Theme previews</title>
                <paragraph>The left-hand side of the main editor has a set of preview tabs. The <strong>Default Preview</strong>
                    tab is visible out of the box and contains most of the frequently used controls in various
                    states. Previews are interactive, so intermediate states (e.g. hover) can be previewed as well.</paragraph>

                </figure>
                <paragraph>Additional tabs can be created from arbitrary scenes in your project. The scene
                    must have a control node as its root to function as a preview. To add a new tab
                    click the <strong>Add Preview</strong> button and select the saved scene from your file system.</paragraph>

                </figure>
                <paragraph>If you make changes to the scene, they will not be reflected in the preview
                    automatically. To update the preview click the reload button on the toolbar.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Previews can also be used to quickly select the theme type to edit. Select the
                    picker tool from the toolbar and hover over the preview area to highlight control
                    nodes. Highlighted control nodes display their class name, or type variation if available.
                    Clicking on the highlighted control opens it for editing on the right-hand side.</paragraph>

                <title>Theme types and items</title>
                <paragraph>The right-hand side of the theme editor provides a list of theme types available
                    in the edited theme resource, and the contents of the selected type. The list of
                    type's items is divided into several tabs, corresponding to each data type available
                    in the theme (colors, constants, styles, etc.). If the <strong>Show Default</strong> option is
                    enabled, then for each built-in type its default theme values are displayed, greyed
                    out. If the option is disabled, only the items available in the edited theme itself
                    are displayed.</paragraph>
                <figure align="center">

                </figure>
                <paragraph>Individual items from the default theme can be added to the current theme by
                    clicking on the <strong>Override</strong> button next to the item. You can also override all
                    the default items of the selected theme type by clicking on the <strong>Override All</strong>
                    button. Overridden properties can then be removed with the <strong>Remove Item</strong> button.
                    Properties can also be renamed using the <strong>Rename Item</strong> button, and completely
                    custom properties can be added to the list using the text field below it.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Overridden theme items can be edited directly in the right-hand panel, unless they
                    are resources. Resources have rudimentary controls available for them, but must be
                    edited in the Inspector dock instead.</paragraph>

                </figure>
                <paragraph>Styleboxes have a unique feature available, where you can pin an individual
                    stylebox from the list. Pinned stylebox acts like the leader of the pack, and
                    all styleboxes of the same type are updated alongside it when you change its
                    properties. This allows you to edit properties of several styleboxes at the
                    same time.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>While theme types can be picked from a preview, they can also be added manually.
                    Clicking the plus button next to the type list opens the <strong>Add item Type</strong> menu.
                    In that menu you can either select a type from the list, or you can enter an
                    arbitrary name to create a custom type. Text field also filters the list of control
                    nodes.</paragraph>

            </figure>
            <paragraph>You can create, rename and remove individual theme items here by clicking the
                corresponding <strong>Add X Item</strong> and specifying their name. You can also mass delete
                theme items either by their data type (using the brush icon in the list) or by
                their quality. <strong>Remove Class Items</strong> will remove all built-in theme items you
                have customized for a control node type. <strong>Remove Custom Items</strong> will remove all
                the custom theme items for the selected type. Finally, <strong>Remove All Items</strong> will
                remove everything from the type.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>From the <strong>Import Items</strong> tab you can import theme items from other themes. You can
                import items from the default Godot theme, the Godot editor theme, or another custom
                theme. You can import individual or multiple items, and you can decide whether to
                copy or omit their data as well. There are several ways you can select and deselect the
                items, including by hand, by hierarchy, by data type, and everything. Opting to
                include the data will copy all theme items as they are to your theme. Omitting the data
                will create the items of the corresponding data type and name, but will leave them empty,
                creating a template of a theme in a way.</paragraph>
