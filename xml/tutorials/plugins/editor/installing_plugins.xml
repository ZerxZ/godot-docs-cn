        <title>Installing plugins</title>
        <paragraph>Godot features an editor plugin system with numerous plugins developed by the
            community. Plugins can extend the editor's functionality with new nodes,
            additional docks, convenience features, and more.</paragraph>

            <title>Finding plugins</title>
            <paragraph>The preferred way to find Godot plugins is to use the
                <reference name="Asset Library" refuri="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/">Asset Library</reference><target ids="asset-library" names="asset\ library" refuri="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/"></target>. While it can be
                browsed online, it's more convenient to use it directly from the editor.
                To do so, click the <strong>AssetLib</strong> tab at the top of the editor:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>You can also find assets on code hosting websites such as GitHub.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>Some repositories describe themselves as "plugins" but may not actually be
                    <emphasis>editor</emphasis> plugins. This is especially the case for scripts that are intended
                    to be used in a running project. You don't need to enable such plugins to
                    use them. Download them and extract the files in your project folder.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>One way to distinguish editor plugins from non-editor plugins is to look for
                    a <literal>plugin.cfg</literal> file in the repository that hosts the plugin. If the
                    repository contains a <literal>plugin.cfg</literal> file in a folder placed in the
                    <literal>addons/</literal> folder, then it is an editor plugin.</paragraph>

            <title>Installing a plugin</title>
            <paragraph>To install a plugin, download it as a ZIP archive. On the Asset Library, this
                can be done using the <strong>Download</strong> button, either from the editor or using the
                Web interface.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>On GitHub, if a plugin has <emphasis>tags</emphasis> (versions) declared, go to the <strong>Releases</strong>
                tab to download a stable release. This ensures you download a version that was
                declared to be stable by its author.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>On GitHub, if the plugin doesn't have any <emphasis>tags</emphasis> declared, use the <strong>Download ZIP</strong>
                button to download a ZIP of the latest revision:</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/plugins/editor/img/installing_plugins_github_download_zip.png'}" original_uri="img/installing_plugins_github_download_zip.png" uri="tutorials/plugins/editor/img/installing_plugins_github_download_zip.png"></image>
            <paragraph>Extract the ZIP archive and move the <literal>addons/</literal> folder it contains into your
                project folder. If your project already contains an <literal>addons/</literal> folder, move the
                plugin's <literal>addons/</literal> folder into your project folder to merge the new folder
                contents with the existing one. Your file manager may ask you whether to write
                into the folder; answer <strong>Yes</strong>. No files will be overwritten in the process.</paragraph>

            <title>Enabling a plugin</title>
            <paragraph>To enable the freshly installed plugin, open <strong>Project &gt; Project Settings</strong> at
                the top of the editor then go the <strong>Plugins</strong> tab. If the plugin was packaged
                correctly, you should see it in the list of plugins. Click on the
                <strong>Enable</strong> checkbox to enable the plugin.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>You can use the plugin immediately after enabling it; there's no need to restart
                the editor. Likewise, disabling a plugin can be done without having to restart
                the editor.</paragraph>
