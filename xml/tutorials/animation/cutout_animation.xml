                is a type of <reference name="stop motion animation" refuri="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion">stop motion animation</reference>
                in which pieces of paper (or other thin material) are cut into special shapes
                and arranged in two-dimensional representations of characters and objects.
                Characters' bodies are usually made out of several pieces. The pieces are
                arranged and photographed once for each frame of the film. The animator moves
                and rotates the parts in small increments between each shot to create the
                illusion of movement when the images are played back quickly in sequence.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Simulations of cutout animation can now be created using software as seen in
                <reference name="South Park" refuri="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park">South Park</reference> and <reference name="Jake and the Never Land Pirates" refuri="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_and_the_Never_Land_Pirates">Jake and the Never

            <paragraph>In video games, this technique has also become popular. Examples of

            <paragraph>The first node of the model is the hip.
                Generally, both in 2D and 3D, the hip is the root of the skeleton. This
                makes it easier to animate:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Next will be the torso. The torso needs to be a child of the hip, so
                create a child sprite and load the torso texture, later accommodate it properly:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>This looks good. Let's see if our hierarchy works as a skeleton by
                rotating the torso. We can do this be pressing <literal classes="kbd">E</literal> to enter rotate mode,
                and dragging with the left mouse button. To exit rotate mode hit <literal classes="kbd">ESC</literal>.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Continue adding body pieces, starting with the
                right arm. Make sure to put each sprite in its correct place in the hierarchy,
                so its rotations and translations are relative to its parent:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>With the left arm there's a problem. In 2D, child nodes appear in front of
                their parents:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>We want the left arm to appear <emphasis>behind</emphasis>
                the hip and the torso. We could move the left arm nodes behind the hip (above
                the hip node in the scene hierarchy), but then the left arm is no longer in its
                proper place in the hierarchy. This means it wouldn't be affected by the movement
                of the torso. We'll fix this problem with <literal>RemoteTransform2D</literal> nodes.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>You can also fix depth ordering problems by adjusting the Z property

            <title>Skeletons</title>
            <paragraph>In Godot there is a helper to create "bones" between nodes. The bone-linked
                nodes are called skeletons.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>As an example, let's turn the right arm into a skeleton. To create
                a skeleton, a chain of nodes must be selected from top to bottom:</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout11.png'}" original_uri="img/tuto_cutout11.png" uri="tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout11.png"></image>
            <paragraph>Then, click on the Skeleton menu and select <literal>Make Bones</literal>.</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout12.png'}" original_uri="img/tuto_cutout12.png" uri="tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout12.png"></image>
            <paragraph>This will add bones covering the arm, but the result may be surprising.</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout13.png'}" original_uri="img/tuto_cutout13.png" uri="tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout13.png"></image>
            <paragraph>Why does the hand lack a bone? In Godot, a bone connects a
                node with its parent. And there's currently no child of the hand node.
                With this knowledge let's try again.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The first step is creating an endpoint node. Any kind of node will do,
                but <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_marker2d#class-marker2d"><inline classes="std std-ref">Marker2D</inline></reference> is preferred because it's
                visible in the editor. The endpoint node will ensure that the last bone
                has orientation.</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout14.png'}" original_uri="img/tuto_cutout14.png" uri="tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout14.png"></image>
            <paragraph>Now select the whole chain, from the endpoint to the arm and create
                bones:</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout15.png'}" original_uri="img/tuto_cutout15.png" uri="tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout15.png"></image>
            <paragraph>The result resembles a skeleton a lot more, and now the arm and forearm
                can be selected and animated.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Create endpoints for all important extremities. Generate bones for all
                articulable parts of the cutout, with the hip as the ultimate connection
                between all of them.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>You may notice that an extra bone is created when connecting the hip and torso.
                Godot has connected the hip node to the scene root with a bone, and we don't
                want that. To fix this, select the root and hip node, open the Skeleton menu,
                click <literal>clear bones</literal>.</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout15_2.png'}" original_uri="img/tuto_cutout15_2.png" uri="tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout15_2.png"></image>
            <paragraph>Your final skeleton should look something like this:</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout16.png'}" original_uri="img/tuto_cutout16.png" uri="tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout16.png"></image>
            <paragraph>You might have noticed a second set of endpoints in the hands. This will make
                sense soon.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Now that the whole figure is rigged, the next step is setting up the IK
                chains. IK chains allow for more natural control of extremities.</paragraph>
        </section>
        <section ids="ik-chains" names="ik\ chains">
            <title>IK chains</title>
            <paragraph>IK stands for inverse kinematics. It's a convenient technique for animating the
                position of hands, feet and other extremities of rigs like the one we've made.
                Imagine you want to pose a character's foot in a specific position on the ground.
                Without IK chains, each motion of the foot would require rotating and positioning
                several other bones (the shin and the thigh at least). This would be quite
                complex and lead to imprecise results. IK allows us to move the foot directly
                while the shin and thigh self-adjust.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph><strong>IK chains in Godot currently work in the editor only</strong>, not
                    at runtime. They are intended to ease the process of setting keyframes, and are
                    not currently useful for techniques like procedural animation.</paragraph>
            </note>
            <paragraph>To create an IK chain, select a chain of bones from endpoint to
                the base for the chain. For example, to create an IK chain for the right
                leg, select the following:</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout17.png'}" original_uri="img/tuto_cutout17.png" uri="tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout17.png"></image>
            <paragraph>Then enable this chain for IK. Go to Edit &gt; Make IK Chain.</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout18.png'}" original_uri="img/tuto_cutout18.png" uri="tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout18.png"></image>
            <paragraph>As a result, the base of the chain will turn <emphasis>Yellow</emphasis>.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Once the IK chain is set up, grab any child or grand-child of the base of the
                chain (e.g. a foot), and move it. You'll see the rest of the chain adjust as you
                adjust its position.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Special contextual elements appear in the top toolbar when the animation editor
                    window is open:</paragraph>

                <paragraph>The key button inserts location, rotation, and scale keyframes for the
                    selected objects or bones at the current playhead position.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The "loc", "rot", and "scl" toggle buttons to the left of the key button modify
                    its function, allowing you to specify which of the three properties keyframes
                    will be created for.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Here's an illustration of how this can be useful: Imagine you have a node which
                    already has two keyframes animating its scale only. You want to add an
                    overlapping rotation movement to the same node. The rotation movement should
                    begin and end at different times from the scale change that's already set up.
                    You can use the toggle buttons to have only rotation information added when you
                    add a new keyframe. This way, you can avoid adding unwanted scale keyframes
                    which would disrupt the existing scale animation.</paragraph>

            <title>Creating a rest pose</title>
            <paragraph>Think of a rest pose as a default pose that your cutout rig should be set to
                when no other pose is active in your game. Create a rest pose as follows:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>1. Make sure the rig parts are positioned in what looks like a "resting"
                arrangement.</paragraph>
            <enumerated_list enumtype="arabic" prefix="" start="2" suffix=".">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Create a new animation, rename it "rest".</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Select all nodes in your rig (box selection should work fine).</paragraph>
                </list_item>
            </enumerated_list>
            <paragraph>4. Make sure the "loc", "rot", and "scl" toggle buttons are all active in the
                toolbar.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>5. Press the key button. Keys will be inserted for all selected parts storing
                their current arrangement. This pose can now be recalled when necessary in
                your game by playing the "rest" animation you've created.</paragraph>

            <title>Modifying rotation only</title>
            <paragraph>When animating a cutout rig, often it's only the rotation of the nodes that
                needs to change.
                Location and scale are rarely used.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>So when inserting keys, you might find it convenient to have only the "rot"
                toggle active most of the time:</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout22.png'}" original_uri="img/tuto_cutout22.png" uri="tutorials/animation/img/tuto_cutout22.png"></image>
            <paragraph>This will avoid the creation of unwanted animation tracks for position
                and scale.</paragraph>

            <title>Keyframing IK chains</title>
            <paragraph>When editing IK chains, it's not necessary to select the whole chain to
                add keyframes. Selecting the endpoint of the chain and inserting a
                keyframe will automatically insert keyframes for all other parts of the chain too.</paragraph>

            <title>Visually move a sprite behind its parent</title>
            <paragraph>Sometimes it is necessary to have a node change its visual depth relative to
                its parent node during an animation. Think of a character facing the camera,
                who pulls something out from behind his back and holds it out in front of him.
                During this animation the whole arm and the object in his hand would need to
                change their visual depth relative to the body of the character.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To help with this there's a keyframable "Behind Parent" property on all
                Node2D-inheriting nodes. When planning your rig, think about the movements it
                will need to perform and give some thought to how you'll use "Behind Parent"
                and/or RemoteTransform2D nodes. They provide overlapping functionality.</paragraph>
