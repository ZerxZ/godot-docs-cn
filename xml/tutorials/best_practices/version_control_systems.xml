            <paragraph>Godot also supports the use of version control systems in the editor itself.
                However, version control in the editor requires a plugin for the specific VCS
                you're using.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>As of October 2025, there is only a Git plugin available, but the community may
                create additional VCS plugins.</paragraph>
            <section ids="official-git-plugin" names="official\ git\ plugin">
                <title>Official Git plugin</title>
                <paragraph>Using Git from inside the editor is supported with an official plugin.
                    You can find the latest releases on

            <note>
                <paragraph>This lists files and folders that should be ignored from version control in
                    Godot 4.1 and later.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The list of files of folders that should be ignored from version control in
                    Godot 3.x and Godot 4.0 is <strong>entirely</strong> different. This is important, as Godot
                    3.x and 4.0 may store sensitive credentials in <literal>export_presets.cfg</literal> (unlike Godot
                    4.1 and later).</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If you are using Godot 3, check the <literal>3.6</literal> version of this documentation page
                    instead.</paragraph>
            </note>
            <paragraph>There are some files and folders Godot automatically creates when opening a
                project in the editor for the first time. To avoid bloating your version control
                repository with generated data, you should add them to your VCS ignore:</paragraph>

                <list_item>
                    <paragraph><literal>.godot/</literal>: This folder stores various project cache data.</paragraph>

            </bullet_list>
            <paragraph>You can make the Godot project manager generate version control metadata for you
                automatically when creating a project. When choosing the <strong>Git</strong> option, this
                creates <literal>.gitignore</literal> and <literal>.gitattributes</literal> files in the project root:</paragraph>

            </figure>
            <paragraph>In existing projects, select the <strong>Project</strong> menu at the top of the editor, then
                choose <strong>Version Control &gt; Generate Version Control Metadata</strong>. This creates the
                same files as if the operation was performed in the project manager.</paragraph>

            <title>Working with Git on Windows</title>
            <paragraph>Most Git for Windows clients are configured with the <literal>core.autocrlf</literal> set to
                <literal>true</literal>. This can lead to files unnecessarily being marked as modified by Git
                due to their line endings being converted from LF to CRLF automatically.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>It is better to set this option as:</paragraph>
            <literal_block force="False" language="gdscript" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">git config --global core.autocrlf input</literal_block>
            <paragraph>Creating version control metadata using the project manager or editor will
                automatically enforce LF line endings using the <literal>.gitattributes</literal> file.
                In this case, you don't need to change your Git configuration.</paragraph>

        <section ids="git-lfs" names="git\ lfs">
            <title>Git LFS</title>
            <paragraph>Git LFS (Large File Storage) is a Git extension that allows you to manage large
                files in your repository. It replaces large files with text pointers inside Git,
                while storing the file contents on a remote server. This is useful for
                managing large assets, such as textures, audio files, and 3D models, without
                bloating your Git repository.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>When using Git LFS you will want to ensure it is setup before you commit any files to your repository.
                    If you have already committed files to your repository, you will need to
                    remove them from the repository and re-add them after setting up Git LFS.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>It is possible to use <literal>git lfs migrate</literal> to convert existing files in your repository, but this is more in-depth and
                    requires a good understanding of Git.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>A common approach is setting up a new repository with Git LFS (and a proper <literal>.gitattributes</literal>), then
                    copying the files from the old repository to the new one. This way, you
                    can ensure that all files are tracked by LFS from the start.</paragraph>
            </note>
            <paragraph>To use Git LFS with Godot, you need to install the Git LFS extension and
                configure it to track the file types you want to manage. You can do this by
                running the following command in your terminal:</paragraph>
            <literal_block force="False" language="gdscript" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">git lfs install</literal_block>
            <paragraph>This will create a <literal>.gitattributes</literal> file in your repository that tells Git to
                use LFS for the specified file types. You can add more file types by modifying
                the <literal>.gitattributes</literal> file. For example, to track all GLB files, you can do this by
                running the following command in your terminal:</paragraph>
            <literal_block force="False" language="gdscript" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">git lfs track "*.glb"</literal_block>
            <paragraph>When you add or modify files that are tracked by LFS, Git will automatically
                store them in LFS instead of the regular Git history. You can push and pull
                LFS files just like regular Git files, but keep in mind that LFS files are
                stored separately from the rest of your Git history. This means that you may
                need to install Git LFS on any machine that you clone the repository to in
                order to access the LFS files.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Below is an example <literal>.gitattributes</literal> file that you can use as a starting point for Git LFS.
                These file types were chosen because they are commonly used, but you can modify the list to include any binary types you may have in your project.</paragraph>
