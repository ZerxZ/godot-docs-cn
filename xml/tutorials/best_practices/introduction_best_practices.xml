        <title>Introduction</title>
        <paragraph>This series is a collection of best practices to help you work efficiently with
            Godot.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Godot allows for a great amount of flexibility in how you structure a project's
            codebase and break it down into scenes. Each approach has its pros and
            cons, and they can be hard to weigh until you've worked with the engine for long enough.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>There are always many ways to structure your code and solve specific programming
            problems. It would be impossible to cover them all here.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>That is why each article starts from a real-world problem. We will break down
            each problem in fundamental questions, suggest solutions, analyze the pros and
            cons of each option, and highlight the best course of action for the problem at hand.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>You should start by reading <reference internal="True" refuri="what_are_godot_classes#doc-what-are-godot-classes"><inline classes="std std-ref">Applying object-oriented principles in Godot</inline></reference>. It explains how
            Godot's nodes and scenes relate to classes and objects in other
            Object-Oriented programming languages. It will help you make sense of the rest of the series.</paragraph>
        <note>
            <paragraph>The best practices in Godot rely on Object-Oriented design principles. We
                use tools like the <reference name="single responsibility" refuri="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">single responsibility</reference><target ids="single-responsibility" names="single\ responsibility" refuri="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle"></target> principle and
