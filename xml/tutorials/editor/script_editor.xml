            <paragraph>Godot Engine's script editor is a powerful and fully-integrated text editor
                that not only streamlines the process of writing and debugging code written in
                GDScript but also allows for working with plain text files, providing
                developers with a seamless environment for scripting game logic and behaviors.
                It can highlight your code, automatically indent it, perform syntax checks,
                and much more.
                You can also create breakpoints to debug your project without switching to
                another window.
                The text editor also serves as an offline class reference viewer, which can
                be accessed in several ways as described in the

            <title>Usage</title>
            <paragraph>If you are using GDScript in your project, the built-in text editor in
                Godot provides everything you need, serving as a one-stop location to
                fully utilize the Godot Engine. Nearly all parameters that can be adjusted via
                the user interface can also be modified directly through code.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>If you would like to use an external text editor or prefer to use C#
                    in your project, see <reference internal="True" refuri="external_editor#doc-external-editor"><inline classes="std std-ref">Using an external text editor</inline></reference> and
                    <reference internal="True" refuri="../scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics#doc-c-sharp-setup-external-editor"><inline classes="std std-ref">Configuring an external editor</inline></reference>.</paragraph>
            </note>
            <tip>
                <paragraph>Similar to many parts of the Godot's interface, the text editor can
                    also be customized by changing its settings to your liking. You can access
                    these settings by opening <strong>Editor &gt; Editor Settings</strong> and going to the <strong>Text Editor</strong>
                    group.</paragraph>
            </tip>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/editor/img/editor_ui_script_editor_open.webp'}" original_uri="img/editor_ui_script_editor_open.webp" uri="tutorials/editor/img/editor_ui_script_editor_open.webp"></image>
            <paragraph>You can open the Script Editor using the <strong>Script</strong> button in the workspace selector,
                located at the top center of Godot's interface.
                Alternatively, you can use the <strong>Open Script</strong> button next to a node in the
                Scene Tree dock, or double-click on a <literal>.gd</literal> file or a recognized text file in
                the FileSystem dock to open it directly in the Script Editor.</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/editor/img/editor_ui_script_editor_menu.webp'}" original_uri="img/editor_ui_script_editor_menu.webp" uri="tutorials/editor/img/editor_ui_script_editor_menu.webp"></image>
            <paragraph>Once it is open, you will see the text editor menus at the top, below the scene
                switcher. Next to the menus, you'll find buttons to open the online documentation
                or search within the built-in class reference. To the right of these buttons are
                two navigation arrows that allow you to navigate through your viewing history.
                Finally, you can use the float button to
                separate the text editor from Godot's window, which is useful if you are working
                with multiple monitors.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Underneath the menus on the left, you will see the script panel. In the center,
                adjacent to the script panel, is the coding area. Beneath the coding area is the
                status bar, which displays the error and warning count in the code.
                Clicking on the error or warning icons will show the list of errors with
                the line numbers. Clicking on one will jump to that line.
                You can also choose to ignore warnings by opening the list and
                clicking <literal>Ignore</literal>.
                The status bar also lets you change the zoom level of the code by clicking
                the percentage value. You can also use <literal classes="kbd">Ctrl + Mouse Wheel</literal>
                (<literal classes="kbd">Cmd + Mouse Wheel</literal> on Mac) to achieve the same effect.
                The status bar also shows the current position of the caret in terms of line and
                column, and whether the indentation is done using tabs, or spaces.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Many of the actions performed in the text editor can also be executed using
                shortcuts. The actions show their corresponding shortcuts next to them.
                For a complete shortcut list, see the <reference internal="True" refuri="default_key_mapping#doc-default-key-mapping-shortcuts-text-editor"><inline classes="std std-ref">text editor shortcuts</inline></reference>.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Below the menus, on the left panel, you will see a list of opened files and documentation
                    pages. Depending on the file type, this list will have an icon next
                    to the file name. For example, the <image alt="script" candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/editor/img/script_editor_icons/Script.webp'}" original_uri="img/script_editor_icons/Script.webp" uri="tutorials/editor/img/script_editor_icons/Script.webp"></image> icon means that it is a GDScript.
                    the <image alt="scriptcsharp" candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/editor/img/script_editor_icons/ScriptCSharp.webp'}" original_uri="img/script_editor_icons/ScriptCSharp.webp" uri="tutorials/editor/img/script_editor_icons/ScriptCSharp.webp"></image> means it is a C# script.

                    built-in class reference. Finally, the <image alt="toolscript" candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/editor/img/script_editor_icons/ToolScript.webp'}" original_uri="img/script_editor_icons/ToolScript.webp" uri="tutorials/editor/img/script_editor_icons/ToolScript.webp"></image> means it is a currently running
                    script (See <reference internal="True" refuri="../plugins/running_code_in_the_editor#doc-running-code-in-the-editor"><inline classes="std std-ref">tool annotation</inline></reference> for more on this).
                    Hovering a file will show a tooltip with its relative location in the project folder.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>On the status bar, clicking the left arrow hides the script panel, clicking
                    on the right arrow shows it.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If you did not change any settings, the file names may also have a different coloring.
                    This helps you identify the recently edited files by highlighting them. This behavior
                    can be changed in the <strong>Editor &gt; Editor Settings</strong> by adjusting the <strong>Script Temperature</strong>
                    properties in the <strong>Text Editor</strong> section.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The filter bar above the file names introduces a handy case-insensitive search to
                    find a specific file. Even if you just type the letters of a file name into the
                    bar, files containing these letters in order will also appear. Assume that there
                    is a file named <literal>button.gd</literal> in the list. If you type <literal>btn</literal> into the filter bar,
                    this file will appear in the results. To reset the filter, clear the filter bar.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>An asterisk (*) next to a file name indicates that the file has unsaved changes.</paragraph>
                <tip>
                    <paragraph>If you just enter "*" in the filter bar, you can display all unsaved files.</paragraph>
                </tip>
                <paragraph>You can drag a file to change the ordering. Middle-clicking on a file closes it.
                    Right-clicking on a file provides several options to save or close files, or to
                    copy the relative path of the file. On this menu:</paragraph>
                <paragraph>You can also use <strong>Move Up</strong> and <strong>Move Down</strong> to change the order of the file, or use <strong>Sort</strong>
                    to sort all files alphabetically. <strong>Toggle Scripts Panel</strong> hides the panel, which
                    can be displayed again using the right arrow on the status bar.
                    <strong>Close Docs</strong> closes all opened in-class reference documents leaving only
                    script files open. <strong>Show in FileSystem</strong> finds and highlights the file in the
                    FileSystem dock.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Below the file list, you'll see the name of the currently open file. The button
                    next to this switches the ordering of the methods defined in this file between
                    alphabetical and as they appear. Under this is the outline of the file. If this
                    is a script file, it will contain the list of defined methods. If, however, a
                    class reference page is open, this area will show the table of contents of this
                    document. Clicking on an item in this list will jump to the respective function
                    or section in the file. Similarly, the <strong>Filter Methods</strong> bar lets you search
                    for a specific function or section within the selected document with the same
                    behavior as filtering scripts.</paragraph>

                            text by checking the <strong>Selection Only</strong> checkbox in the find and replace bar. You can also use <literal classes="kbd">Ctrl + D</literal> to
                            additionally select the next instance of the currently selected text, allowing you to perform an in-line replacement on multiple occurrences.</paragraph>

                        and <strong>Replace...</strong> buttons. The only difference in the latter window is an additional text
                        field that automatically fills in the search results panel when the <strong>Replace...</strong> button
                        is clicked. The replacement operation is only executed if you click the <strong>Replace All</strong>
                        button in this bottom panel, allowing you to also edit the word to replace later within
                        this panel.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>The coding area is where you will type your scripts if you are using the built-in text editor.
                    It offers highlighting and auto-completion features to help you while you code.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The coding area shows line numbers on the left side. Below the navigation arrows on the
                    right side, there is a clickable minimap that provides an overview of the entire script,
                    allowing you to scroll through it.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If a line of code is long enough (more than 80 characters, by default), the text editor
                    will display a vertical line that can be used as a soft guideline. For a hard guideline,
                    this value is set to 100 characters, by default. Both values can be changed, or the
                    display of the line can be toggled in the "Appearance" settings of the text editor.</paragraph>

                    function. Clicking it opens the documentation of the original function.

                    that it is a receiving method of a signal. Clicking it shows where the signal is coming
                    from. A <image alt="foldable" candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/editor/img/script_editor_icons/Foldable.webp'}" original_uri="img/script_editor_icons/Foldable.webp" uri="tutorials/editor/img/script_editor_icons/Foldable.webp"></image> icon to the left of the line denotes a foldable block.

                    click to collapse or expand it.
                    Alternatively, the ellipsis (...) icon can also be clicked to expand a folded block.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The example below summarizes the paragraph above. Lines 52, 56, and 58 are foldable blocks,
                    line 57 is a code region with the name "New Code Region," which you can also fold, and line
                    62 is a folded block.
                    Line 53 is a bookmark, which can quickly be jumped to using the <strong>Go To &gt; Bookmarks</strong> menu.
                    Line 55 is a breakpoint that can be used in <reference internal="True" refuri="../scripting/debug/overview_of_debugging_tools#doc-overview-of-debugging-tools"><inline classes="std std-ref">debugging</inline></reference>.</paragraph>

                    bookmark icon colors can be customized. You can experiment them by opening the text editor
                    settings navigating to <strong>Editor &gt; Editor Settings &gt; Text Editor</strong> section.</paragraph>
