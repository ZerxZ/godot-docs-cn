            <paragraph>Due to limitations on the Godot or Web platform side, the following features
                are currently missing:</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>No debugging support. This means GDScript debugging/profiling, live scene
                        editing, the Remote Scene tree dock and other features that rely on the debugger
                        protocol will not work.</paragraph>

            <title>Editing and running a project</title>
            <paragraph>Unlike the native version of Godot, the web editor is constrained to a single
                window. Therefore, it cannot open a new window when running the project.
                Instead, when you run the project by clicking the Run button or pressing
                <literal classes="kbd">F5</literal>, it will appear to "replace" the editor window.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The web editor offers an alternative way to deal with the editor and game
                windows (which are now "tabs"). You can switch between the <strong>Editor</strong> and
                <strong>Game</strong> tabs using the buttons on the top. You can also close the running game
                or editor by clicking the <strong>×</strong> button next to those tabs.</paragraph>

            <title>Where are my project files?</title>
            <paragraph>Due to browser security limitations, the editor will save the project files to
                the browser's IndexedDB storage. This storage isn't accessible as a regular folder
                on your machine, but is abstracted away in a database.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>You can download the project files as a ZIP archive by using
                <strong>Project &gt; Tools &gt; Download Project Source</strong>. This can be used to export the
                project using a <reference name="native Godot editor" refuri="https://godotengine.org/download">native Godot editor</reference>,
                since exporting from the web editor isn't supported yet.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In the future, it may be possible to use the
                <reference name="HTML5 FileSystem API" refuri="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystem">HTML5 FileSystem API</reference>
                to store the project files on the user's filesystem as the native editor would do.
                However, this isn't implemented yet.</paragraph>
