            <title>Introduction</title>
            <paragraph>In certain situations, it may be desirable to limit what features can be used
                in the Godot editor. For example, a UI designer on a team who doesn't need to
                see 3D features, or an educator slowly introducing features to students. Godot
                has a built-in system called "feature profiles" to do this.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>With feature profiles, major features and nodes can be hidden from the editor.
                This only hides parts of the interface and does not actually remove support for
                these features, so scenes and scripts relying on those features will still work fine.
                This also means feature profiles are not an optimization technique. For
                information on how to optimize Godot see <reference internal="True" refuri="../performance/index#doc-performance"><inline classes="std std-ref">Performance</inline></reference>.</paragraph>

            <title>Creating a profile</title>
            <paragraph>To manage editor features go to <strong>Editor &gt; Manage Editor Features</strong>. This
                will open the <strong>Manage Editor Feature Profiles</strong> window. By default there
                will be no profile. Click on <strong>Create Profile</strong> and give it a name. You will
                then see a list of all the features in the Godot editor.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The first section allows major editor features to be removed, such as the 3D
                editor or scripting editor. Below the main features is every class and node in
                Godot, which can be disabled as well. Click on a node and all of its properties
                and options will be listed in the <strong>Extra Items</strong> box, these can all be
                individually disabled.</paragraph>

        <section ids="sharing-a-profile" names="sharing\ a\ profile">
            <title>Sharing a profile</title>
            <paragraph>To share profiles between editors click on the <strong>Export</strong> button. Save the custom
                profile somewhere as a <literal>.profile</literal> file. To use this in another editor open that
                editor's <strong>Manage Editor Feature Profiles</strong> window and click import, then select the
                <literal>.profile</literal> file.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This process is potentially cumbersome however if a large amount of computers need
                custom profiles. As an alternative, you can enable self-contained mode for Godot,
                which allows putting all editor configuration in the same folder as the editor binary.
                See <reference internal="True" refuri="../io/data_paths#doc-data-paths-self-contained-mode"><inline classes="std std-ref">Self-contained mode</inline></reference> for details.</paragraph>
