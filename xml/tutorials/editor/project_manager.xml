        <title>Using the Project Manager</title>
        <paragraph>When you launch Godot, the first window you see is the Project Manager. It lets
            you create, remove, import, or play game projects:</paragraph>

        <paragraph>In Project Manager Settings, you can change the interface <strong>language</strong> from the language
            dropdown menu, which is the system default language by default.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>You can also change the <strong>theme</strong> of the editor, the <strong>display scale</strong> for different interface
            element sizes, and the availability of online functionality using <strong>network mode</strong>.
            If network mode is online, Godot will also check and inform you about new versions of Godot.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The <strong>directory naming convention</strong> can also be changed to replace spaces according to the chosen format
            when creating folders automatically.</paragraph>

                    Godot's file browser. You can pick a location or type the folder's path in the

                    The up arrow navigates to parent folder.
                    On the right side of the path field, there are buttons to refresh the current folder's contents,
                    favorite/unfavorite the current folder, and show/hide hidden folders.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Next, the buttons to switch the display type of the folders and files between grid view and list view

            <paragraph>The first time you open this tab you'll notice that it's asking you to go online.
                For privacy reasons the project manager, and Godot editor, can't access the internet
                by default. To enable accessing the internet click the <strong>Go Online</strong> button. This will
                also allow project manager to notify you about updates. If you wish to turn this off
                in the future go into project manager settings and change <strong>Network Mode</strong> to "Offline"</paragraph>

            <title>Managing projects with tags</title>
            <paragraph>For users with a lot of projects on one PC it can be a lot to keep track of. To aid
                in this Godot allows you to create project tags. To add a tag to a project click on the
                project in the project manager, then click on the <strong>Manage Tags</strong> button</paragraph>
            <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/editor/img/editor_ui_intro_project_manager_11.webp'}" original_uri="img/editor_ui_intro_project_manager_11.webp" uri="tutorials/editor/img/editor_ui_intro_project_manager_11.webp"></image>
            <paragraph>This will open up the manage project tags window. To add a tag click the plus button.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Type out the tag name, and click <strong>OK</strong>. Your project will now have a tag added to it.
                These tags can be used for any other project in your project manager.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To show projects with a specific tag only, you can click on the tags or write <literal>tag:</literal>
                and type the tag you would like to search for in the filter bar. To limit the results
                using multiple tags, you can click on another tag or add <literal>tag:</literal> after
                a space and type another tag in the filter bar.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In addition, tags will stay with projects. So if you tag your project, send it to
                another machine, and import it into the project manager you will see the tags
                you created.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To remove a tag from your project manager it must be removed from all the projects it's
                used by. Once that's done close the project manager, open it up again, and the tag should
                be gone.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>If a project is immediately crashing on startup, or crashing frequently during
                editing it can be opened in recovery mode, to attempt to make it more stable
                while looking for the source of the crashing to fix it.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Usually a project should open in recovery mode automatically when you re-open it
                after a crash. If it doesn't you can manually open recovery mode by selecting the
                project in the project manager, to do that select the project from your list of
                projects, click the dropdown button next to the edit node, and select <literal>Edit in
