            <title>前言</title>
            <note>
                <paragraph>This page focuses specifically on the feature set exposed through OpenXR.
                    Parts of the functionality presented here also applies to WebXR and can by provided
                    by other XR interfaces.</paragraph>
            </note>
            <paragraph>When discussing hand tracking it is important to know that there are differences of opinion as to where lines are drawn.
                The practical result of this is that there are differences in implementation between the different OpenXR runtimes.
                You may find yourself in a place where chosen hardware doesn't support a piece of the puzzle or does things differently
                enough from the other platforms that you need to do extra work.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>That said, recent improvements to the OpenXR specification are closing these gaps and as platforms implement
                these improvements we are getting closer to a future where we have either full portability between platforms
                or at least a clear way to detect the capabilities of a platform.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>When we look at the early days of VR the focus of the major platforms was on tracked controller based input.
                Here we are tracking a physical device that also has buttons for further input.
                From the tracking data we can infer the location of the player's hands but no further information is known,
                traditionally it was left up to the game to implement a mechanism to display the player's hand and animate
                the fingers based on further input from the controller, be it due to buttons being pressed or through proximity
                sensors.
                Often fingers are also placed based on context, what the user is holding, and what action a user is performing.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>More recently optical hand tracking has become a popular solution, where cameras track the user's hands
                and full tracking data for the hand and finger positions becomes available.
                Many vendors saw this as completely separate from controller tracking and introduced independent APIs to
                access hand and finger positions and orientation data.
                When handling input, it was up to the game developer to implement a gesture detection mechanism.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This split also exists in OpenXR, where controller tracking is handled primarily by the action map system,
                while optical hand tracking is primarily handled by the hand tracking API extension.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>However, the world is not that black and white and we're seeing a number of scenarios
                where we cross the line:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Devices that fit in both categories, such as tracked gloves
                            and controllers such as the Index controller that also perform finger tracking.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>XR Runtimes that implement inferred hand tracking from controller data as a means
                            to solve proper finger placement for multiple controllers.</paragraph>
                    </list_item>
                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>XR applications that wish to seamlessly switch between controller and hand tracking
                            offering the same user experience regardless of approach used.</paragraph>
                    </list_item>
                </bullet_list>
            </block_quote>
            <paragraph>OpenXR is answering this call by introducing further extensions that lets us query the capabilities of
                the XR runtime/hardware or that add further functionality across this divide.
                The problem that currently does remain is that there are gaps in adopting these extensions,
                with some platforms thus not reporting capabilities to their full extent.
                As such you may need to test for the features available on specific hardware
                and adjust your approach accordingly.</paragraph>

            <title>The Hand Tracking API</title>
            <paragraph>As mentioned in our introduction, the hand tracking API is primarily used with optical hand tracking
                and on many platforms only works when the user is not holding a controller.
                Some platforms support controller inferred hand tracking meaning that you will get hand tracking data
                even if the user is holding a controller.
                This includes SteamVR, Meta Quest (currently native only but Meta link support is likely coming),
                and hopefully soon others as well.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The hand tracking implementation in Godot has been standardized around the Godot Humanoid Skeleton
                and works both in OpenXR and WebXR. The instructions below will thus work in both environments.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In order to use the hand tracking API with OpenXR you first need to enable it.
                This can be done in the project settings:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>For some standalone XR devices you also need to configure the hand tracking extension in export settings,
                for instance for Meta Quest:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Now you need to add 3 components into your scene for each hand:</paragraph>

                In the action map you can map various inputs like the trigger or joystick on the controller

                    is a new core extension which supports pinch, grasp, and poke gestures and related poses.
                    There is still limited support for this extension but it should become available in more
                    runtimes in the near future.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>The pinch gesture is triggered by pinching your thumb and index finger together.
                    This is often used as a select gesture for menu systems, similar to using your controller
                    to point at an object and press the trigger to select and is thus often mapped as such.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>The grasp gesture is triggered by making a fist and is often used to pick items up,

                <paragraph>The poke gesture is triggered by extending your index finger, this one is a bit
                    of an exception as the pose at the tip of your index finger is often used to poke
                    an interactable object. The <literal>poke pose</literal> is a pose positioned on the tip of the index finger.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Finally the <literal>aim activate (ready)</literal> input is defined as an input that is 1.0/true
                    when the index finger is extended and pointing at a target that can be activated.
                    How runtimes interpret this, is not clear.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>With this setup the normal <literal>left_hand</literal> and <literal>right_hand</literal> trackers are used and you can

                    was introduced by Microsoft and loosely mimics the simple controller profile.
                    Meta has also added support for this extension but only on their native OpenXR client,
                    it is currently not available over Meta Link.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Pinch support is exposed through the <literal>select</literal> input, the value of which
                    is 0.0 when the tip of the thumb and index finger are apart
                    and 1.0 when they are together.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Note that in this profile the <literal>aim pose</literal> is redefined as a pose between thumb
                    and index finger, oriented so a ray cast can be used to identify a target.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Grasp support is exposed through the <literal>squeeze</literal> input, the value of which
                    is 0.0 when the hand is open, and 1.0 when a fist is made.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>With this setup the normal <literal>left_hand</literal> and <literal>right_hand</literal> trackers are used and you can

                    was introduced by HTC and is defined similarly to the Microsoft extension.
                    It is only supported by HTC for the Focus 3 and Elite XR headsets.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>See the Microsoft hand interaction profile for the gesture support.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The defining difference is that this extension introduces two new trackers,
                    <literal>/user/hand_htc/left</literal> and <literal>/user/hand_htc/right</literal>.
                    This means that extra logic needs to be implemented to switch between the default trackers
                    and the HTC specific trackers when the user puts down, or picks up, their controller.</paragraph>

                <title>Simple controller profile</title>
                <paragraph>The simple controller profile is a standard core profile defined as a fallback profile
                    when a controller is used for which no profile exists.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>There are a number of OpenXR runtimes that will mimic controllers through
                    the simple controller profile when hand tracking is used.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Unfortunately there is no sound way to determine whether an unknown controller is used
                    or whether hand tracking is emulating a controller through this profile.</paragraph>
                <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/xr/img/openxr_simple_controller_hand.webp'}" uri="tutorials/xr/img/openxr_simple_controller_hand.webp"></image>
                <paragraph>XR runtimes are free to define how the simple controller profile operates,
                    so there is also no certainty to how this profile is mapped to gestures.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The most common mapping seems to be that <literal>select click</literal> is true
                    when the tip of the thumb and index fingers are touching while the
                    user's palm is facing away from the user.
                    <literal>menu click</literal> will be true when tip of the thumb and index fingers
                    are touching while the user's palm is facing towards the user.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>With this setup the normal <literal>left_hand</literal> and <literal>right_hand</literal> trackers are used and you can
                    thus seamlessly switch between controller and hand tracking input.</paragraph>
                <note>
                    <paragraph>As some of these interaction profiles have overlap it is important to know
                        that you can add each profile to your action map and the XR runtime will choose
                        the best fitting profile.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>For instance, a Meta Quest supports both the Microsoft hand interaction profile
                        and simple controller profile.
                        If both are specified the Microsoft hand interaction profile will take precedence
                        and will be used.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The expectation is that once Meta supports the core hand interaction profile
                        extension, that profile will take precedence over both Microsoft
                        and simple controller profiles.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>If the platform doesn't support any interaction profiles when hand tracking is used,
                    or if you're building an application where you need more complicated gesture support
                    you're going to need to build your own gesture recognition system.</paragraph>
