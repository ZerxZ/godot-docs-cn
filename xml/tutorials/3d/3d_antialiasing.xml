            <paragraph>Due to their limited resolution, scenes rendered in 3D can exhibit aliasing
                artifacts. These artifacts commonly manifest as a "staircase" effect on surface
                edges (edge aliasing) and as flickering and/or sparkles on reflective surfaces
                (specular aliasing).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In the example below, you can notice how
                edges have a blocky appearance. The vegetation is also flickering in and out,
                and thin lines on top of the box have almost disappeared:</paragraph>

            <title>Multisample antialiasing (MSAA)</title>
            <paragraph><emphasis>This is available in all renderers.</emphasis></paragraph>
            <paragraph>This technique is the "historical" way of dealing with aliasing. MSAA is very
                effective on geometry edges (especially at higher levels). MSAA does not
                introduce any blurriness whatsoever.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>MSAA is available in 3 levels: 2×, 4×, 8×. Higher levels are more effective at
                antialiasing edges, but are significantly more demanding. In games with modern
                visuals, sticking to 2× or 4× MSAA is highly recommended as 8× MSAA is usually
                too demanding.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The downside of MSAA is that it only operates on edges. This is because MSAA
                increases the number of <emphasis>coverage</emphasis> samples, but not the number of <emphasis>color</emphasis>
                samples. However, since the number of color samples did not increase, fragment
                shaders are still run for each pixel only once. Therefore, MSAA does not reduce
                transparency aliasing for materials using the <strong>Alpha Scissor</strong> transparency
                mode (1-bit transparency). MSAA is also ineffective on specular aliasing.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To mitigate aliasing on alpha scissor materials,
                <reference internal="True" refuri="standard_material_3d#doc-standard-material-3d-alpha-antialiasing"><inline classes="std std-ref">alpha antialiasing</inline></reference>
                (also called <emphasis>alpha to coverage</emphasis>) can be enabled on specific materials in the
                StandardMaterial3D or ORMMaterial3D properties. Alpha to coverage has a
                moderate performance cost, but it's effective at reducing aliasing on
                transparent materials without introducing any blurriness.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To make specular aliasing less noticeable, use the <reference name="Screen-space roughness limiter" refid="screen-space-roughness-limiter">Screen-space roughness limiter</reference>,
                which is enabled by default.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>MSAA can be enabled in the Project Settings by changing the value of the

            <paragraph>Temporal antialiasing works by <emphasis>converging</emphasis> the result of previously rendered
                frames into a single, high-quality frame. This is a continuous process that
                works by jittering the position of all vertices in the scene every frame. This
                jittering is done to capture sub-pixel detail and should be unnoticeable except
                in extreme situations.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This technique is commonly used in modern games, as it provides the most
                effective form of antialiasing against specular aliasing and other
                shader-induced artifacts. TAA also provides full support for transparency
                antialiasing.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>TAA introduces a small amount of blur when enabled in still scenes, but this
                blurring effect becomes more pronounced when the camera is moving. Another
                downside of TAA is that it can exhibit <emphasis>ghosting</emphasis> artifacts behind moving
                objects. Rendering at a higher framerate will allow TAA to converge faster,
                therefore making those ghosting artifacts less visible.</paragraph>

                compatible with all recent GPUs from any vendor. FSR2 is normally designed to
                improve performance by lowering the internal 3D rendering resolution,
                then upscaling to the output resolution.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>However, unlike FSR1, FSR2 also provides temporal antialiasing. This means FSR2
                can be used at native resolution for high-quality antialiasing, with the input
                resolution being equal to the output resolution. In this situation, enabling
                FSR2 will actually <emphasis>decrease</emphasis> performance, but it will significantly improve
                rendering quality.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Using FSR2 at native resolution is more demanding than using TAA at native
                resolution, so its use is only recommended if you have significant GPU headroom.
                On the bright side, FSR2 provides better antialiasing coverage with less
                blurriness compared to TAA, especially in motion.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Fast approximate antialiasing is a post-processing antialiasing solution. It is
                faster to run than any other antialiasing technique and also supports
                antialiasing transparency. However, since it lacks temporal information, it will
                not do much against specular aliasing.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This technique is still sometimes used in mobile games. However, on desktop
                platforms, FXAA generally fell out of fashion in favor of temporal antialiasing,
                which is much more effective against specular aliasing. Nonetheless, exposing FXAA
                as an in-game option may still be worthwhile for players with low-end GPUs.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Sub-pixel Morphological Antialiasing is a post-processing antialiasing solution.
                It runs slightly slower than FXAA, but produces less blurriness. This is very helpful
                when the screen resolution is 1080p or below. Just like FXAA, SMAA 1x lacks temporal
                information and will therefore not do much against specular aliasing.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Use SMAA 1x if you can't afford MSAA, but find FXAA too blurry.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Combine it with TAA, or even FSR2, to maximize antialiasing at a higher GPU cost

            <paragraph><emphasis>This is available in all renderers.</emphasis></paragraph>
            <paragraph>Supersampling provides the highest quality of antialiasing possible, but it's
                also the most expensive. It works by shading every pixel in the scene multiple
                times. This allows SSAA to antialias edges, transparency <emphasis>and</emphasis> specular aliasing
                at the same time, without introducing potential ghosting artifacts.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The downside of SSAA is its <emphasis>extremely</emphasis> high cost. This cost generally makes
                SSAA difficult to use for game purposes, but you may still find supersampling
                useful for <reference internal="True" refuri="../animation/creating_movies#doc-creating-movies"><inline classes="std std-ref">offline rendering</inline></reference>.</paragraph>

                Since the scale factor is defined per-axis, a scale factor of <literal>1.5</literal> will result
                in 2.25× SSAA while a scale factor of <literal>2.0</literal> will result in 4× SSAA. Since Godot
                uses the hardware's own bilinear filtering to perform the downsampling, the result

            <warning>
                <paragraph>Supersampling also has high video RAM requirements, since it needs to render
                    in the target resolution then <emphasis>downscale</emphasis> to the window size. For example,
                    displaying a project in 3840×2160 (4K resolution) with 4× SSAA will require
                    rendering the scene in 7680×4320 (8K resolution), which is 4 times more

                method, but it is a way of reducing specular aliasing in 3D.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Roughness limiting on import works by specifying a normal map to use as a guide
                for limiting roughness. This is done by selecting the roughness map in the
                FileSystem dock, then going to the Import dock and setting <strong>Roughness &gt; Mode</strong>
                to the color channel the roughness map is stored in (typically <strong>Green</strong>), then
                setting the path to the material's normal map. Remember to click <strong>Reimport</strong>
                at the bottom of the Import dock after setting the path to the normal map.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Since this processing occurs purely on import, it has no performance cost
                whatsoever. However, its visual impact is limited. Limiting roughness on import
                only helps reduce specular aliasing within textures, not the aliasing that
                occurs on geometry edges on detailed meshes.</paragraph>

            <paragraph><strong>There is no "one size fits all" antialiasing technique.</strong> Since antialiasing is
                often demanding on the GPU or can introduce unwanted blurriness, you'll want to
                add a setting to allow players to disable antialiasing.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For projects with a photorealistic art direction, TAA is generally the most
                suitable option. While TAA can introduce ghosting artifacts, there is no other
                technique that combats specular aliasing as well as TAA does. The screen-space
                roughness limiter helps a little, but is far less effective against specular
                aliasing overall. If you have spare GPU power, you can use FSR2 at native
                resolution for a better-looking form of temporal antialiasing compared to
                standard TAA.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For projects with a low amount of reflective surfaces (such as a cartoon
                artstyle), MSAA can work well. MSAA is also a good option if avoiding blurriness
                and temporal artifacts is important, such as in competitive games.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>When targeting low-end platforms such as mobile or integrated graphics, FXAA is
                usually the only viable option. 2× MSAA may be usable in some circumstances,
                but higher MSAA levels are unlikely to run smoothly on mobile GPUs.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Godot allows using multiple antialiasing techniques at the same time. This is
                usually unnecessary, but it can provide better visuals on high-end GPUs or for
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../animation/creating_movies#doc-creating-movies"><inline classes="std std-ref">non-real-time rendering</inline></reference>. For example, to make
                moving edges look better when TAA is enabled, you can also enable MSAA at the
                same time.</paragraph>
