        <title>Introduction to 3D</title>
        <paragraph>Creating a 3D game can be challenging. That extra Z coordinate makes
            many of the common techniques that helped to make 2D games simpler no
            longer work. To aid in this transition, it is worth mentioning that
            Godot uses similar APIs for 2D and 3D. Most nodes are the same and
            are present in both 2D and 3D versions. In fact, it is worth checking
            the 3D platformer tutorial, or the 3D kinematic character tutorials,
            which are almost identical to their 2D counterparts.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Similar to 2D, the tabs below the workspace selector are used to change between

                    is given with the shortcut if the mouse cursor is hovered over a button for one second.
                    Some buttons may have additional functionality if another keypress is performed. A recap

                <paragraph>Godot uses the <reference name="metric" refuri="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system">metric</reference>
                    system for everything in 3D, with 1 unit being equal to 1 meter.
                    Physics and other areas are tuned for this scale. Therefore, attempting to use a
                    different scale is usually a bad idea (unless you know what you are doing).</paragraph>
                <paragraph>When working with 3D assets, it's always best to work in the correct scale (set
                    the unit to metric in your 3D modeling software). Godot allows scaling
                    post-import and, while this works in most cases, in rare situations it may
                    introduce floating-point precision issues (and thus, glitches or artifacts) in
                    delicate areas such as rendering or physics. Make sure your artists always work
                    in the right scale!</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The Y coordinate is used for "up". As for the horizontal X/Z axes, Godot uses a
                    <strong>right-handed</strong> coordinate system. This means that for most objects that need
                    alignment (such as lights or cameras), the Z axis is used as a "pointing
                    towards" direction. This convention roughly means that:</paragraph>

                <title>Navigating the 3D environment</title>
                <paragraph>In 3D environments, it is often important to adjust the viewpoint or angle
                    from which you are viewing the scene.
                    In Godot, navigating the 3D environment in the viewport (or spatial editor)
                    can be done in multiple ways.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The default 3D scene navigation controls are similar to Blender (aiming to
                    have some sort of consistency in the free software pipeline), but
                    options are included to customize mouse buttons and behavior to be
                    similar to other tools in the Editor Settings. To change the controls
                    to Maya or Modo controls, you can navigate to <strong>Editor Settings &gt; Editors &gt; 3D</strong>.
                    Then, under <emphasis>Navigation</emphasis>, search for <emphasis>Navigation Scheme</emphasis>.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Using the default settings, the following shortcuts control how one can

                <paragraph>It is also possible to left-click and hold the manipulator gizmo located

                <paragraph>Left-clicking on one of the colored circles will set the view to the chosen

                    not the View menu on the main toolbar), holding down the right mouse button on the viewport
                    or pressing <literal classes="kbd">Shift + F</literal> switches to "free-look" mode.
                    In this mode you can move the mouse to look around, use the <literal classes="kbd">W</literal> <literal classes="kbd">A</literal>
                    <literal classes="kbd">S</literal> <literal classes="kbd">D</literal> keys to fly around the view, <literal classes="kbd">E</literal> to go up, and <literal classes="kbd">Q</literal> to

                    <literal classes="kbd">Shift + F</literal> again.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>In the free-look mode, you can temporarily increase the flying
                    speed using <literal classes="kbd">Shift</literal> or decrease it using <literal classes="kbd">Alt</literal>. To change and keep the

                <paragraph>In orthogonal mode, holding the right mouse button will pan the view instead.

                <paragraph>The background environment emits some ambient light which appears on surfaces.
                    Still, without any light sources placed in the scene, the scene will appear
                    quite dark unless the background environment is very bright.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Most outdoor scenes have a directional light (the sun or moon), while indoor
                    scenes typically have several positional lights (lamps, torches, …).
