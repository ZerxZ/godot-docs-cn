            <paragraph>As you might have already read in <reference internal="True" refuri="audio_buses#doc-audio-buses"><inline classes="std std-ref">Audio buses</inline></reference>, sound is sent to
                each bus via an AudioStreamPlayer node. There are different kinds
                of AudioStreamPlayers. Each one loads an AudioStream and plays it back.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>An audio stream is an abstract object that emits sound. The sound can come from
                many places, but is most commonly loaded from the filesystem. Audio files can be
                loaded as AudioStreams and placed inside an AudioStreamPlayer. You can find
                information on supported formats and differences in <reference internal="True" refuri="../assets_pipeline/importing_audio_samples#doc-importing-audio-samples"><inline classes="std std-ref">Importing audio samples</inline></reference>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>There are other types of AudioStreams, such as <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_audiostreamrandomizer#class-audiostreamrandomizer"><inline classes="std std-ref">AudioStreamRandomizer</inline></reference>.
                This one picks a different audio stream from a list of streams each time it's played
                back, and applies random pitch and volume shifting. This can be helpful for adding
                variation to sounds that are played back often.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>This is the standard, non-positional stream player. It can play to any bus.
                In 5.1 sound setups, it can send audio to stereo mix or front speakers.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Playback Type is an experimental setting, and could change in future versions
                of Godot. It exists so Web exports use Web Audio-API based samples instead of
                streaming all sounds to the browser, unlike most platforms. This prevents the
                audio from being garbled in single-threaded Web exports. By default, only the
                Web platform will use samples. Changing this setting is not recommended, unless
                you have an explicit reason to. You can change the default playback type
                for the web and other platforms in the project settings under <strong>Audio &gt; General</strong>
                (advanced settings must be turned on to see the setting).</paragraph>

            <paragraph>This is a variant of AudioStreamPlayer, but emits sound in a 2D positional
                environment. When close to the left of the screen, the panning will go left.
                When close to the right side, it will go right.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>Area2Ds can be used to divert sound from any AudioStreamPlayer2Ds they
                    contain to specific buses. This makes it possible to create buses with
                    different reverb or sound qualities to handle action happening in a
                    particular parts of your game world.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>This is a variant of AudioStreamPlayer, but emits sound in a 3D positional
                environment. Depending on the location of the player relative to the screen,

            <paragraph>Similar to AudioStreamPlayer2D, an Area3D can divert the sound to an audio bus.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>This feature is not supported on the web platform if the AudioStreamPlayer's

                        are not enabled.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Godot allows for 3D audio streams that enter a specific Area3D node to send dry
                    and wet audio to separate buses. This is useful when you have several reverb
                    configurations for different types of rooms. This is done by enabling this type
                    of reverb in the <strong>Reverb Bus</strong> section of the Area3D's properties:</paragraph>
                <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/audio/img/audio_stream_reverb_bus.webp'}" original_uri="img/audio_stream_reverb_bus.webp" uri="tutorials/audio/img/audio_stream_reverb_bus.webp"></image>
                <paragraph>At the same time, a special bus layout is created where each Area3D receives the
                    reverb info from each Area3D. A Reverb effect needs to be created and configured
                    in each reverb bus to complete the setup for the desired effect:</paragraph>
                <image candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/audio/img/audio_stream_reverb_bus2.webp'}" original_uri="img/audio_stream_reverb_bus2.webp" uri="tutorials/audio/img/audio_stream_reverb_bus2.webp"></image>
                <paragraph>The Area3D's <strong>Reverb Bus</strong> section also has a parameter named <strong>Uniformity</strong>.
                    Some types of rooms bounce sounds more than others (like a warehouse), so
                    reverberation can be heard almost uniformly across the room even though the
                    source may be far away. Playing around with this parameter can simulate
                    that effect.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>When the relative velocity between an emitter and listener changes, this is
                    perceived as an increase or decrease in the pitch of the emitted sound.
                    Godot can track velocity changes in the AudioStreamPlayer3D and Camera nodes.
                    Both nodes have this property, which must be enabled manually:</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Enable it by setting it depending on how objects will be moved:
                    use <strong>Idle</strong> for objects moved using <literal>_process</literal>, or <strong>Physics</strong>
                    for objects moved using <literal>_physics_process</literal>. The tracking will
                    happen automatically.</paragraph>
