            <paragraph>Godot also supports antialiasing in 3D rendering. This is covered on the
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../3d/3d_antialiasing#doc-3d-antialiasing"><inline classes="std std-ref">3D antialiasing</inline></reference> page.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Due to their limited resolution, scenes rendered in 2D can exhibit aliasing
                artifacts. These artifacts usually manifest in the form of a "staircase" effect on
                geometry edges, and are most noticeable when using nodes such as <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_line2d#class-line2d"><inline classes="std std-ref">Line2D</inline></reference>,
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_polygon2d#class-polygon2d"><inline classes="std std-ref">Polygon2D</inline></reference> or <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_textureprogressbar#class-textureprogressbar"><inline classes="std std-ref">TextureProgressBar</inline></reference>. <reference internal="True" refuri="custom_drawing_in_2d#doc-custom-drawing-in-2d"><inline classes="std std-ref">Custom drawing in 2D</inline></reference>
                can also have aliasing artifacts for methods that don't support antialiasing.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In the example below, you can notice how
                edges have a blocky appearance:</paragraph>

                <image alt="Image is scaled by 2× with nearest-neighbor filtering to make aliasing more noticeable." candidates="{'*': 'tutorials/2d/img/antialiasing_none_scaled.webp'}" original_uri="img/antialiasing_none_scaled.webp" uri="tutorials/2d/img/antialiasing_none_scaled.webp"></image>

            </figure>
            <paragraph>To combat this, Godot supports several methods of enabling antialiasing on 2D rendering.</paragraph>
        </section>
        <section ids="antialiasing-property-in-line2d-and-custom-drawing" names="antialiasing\ property\ in\ line2d\ and\ custom\ drawing">
            <title>Antialiasing property in Line2D and custom drawing</title>
            <paragraph>This is the recommended method, as it has a lower performance impact in most cases.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Line2D has an <strong>Antialiased</strong> property which you can enable in the inspector.
                Also, several methods for <reference internal="True" refuri="custom_drawing_in_2d#doc-custom-drawing-in-2d"><inline classes="std std-ref">Custom drawing in 2D</inline></reference> support an optional
                <literal>antialiased</literal> parameter, which can be set to <literal>true</literal> when calling the
                function.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>These methods do not require MSAA to be enabled, which makes their <emphasis>baseline</emphasis>
                performance cost low. In other words, there is no permanent added cost if you're
                not drawing any antialiased geometry at some point.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The downside of these antialiasing methods is that they work by generating
                additional geometry. If you're generating complex 2D geometry that's updated
                every frame, this may be a bottleneck. Also, Polygon2D, TextureProgressBar, and
                several custom drawing methods don't feature an antialiased property. For these
                nodes, you can use 2D multisample antialiasing instead.</paragraph>

        <section ids="multisample-antialiasing-msaa" names="multisample\ antialiasing\ (msaa)">
            <title>Multisample antialiasing (MSAA)</title>
            <paragraph><emphasis>This is only available in the Forward+ and Mobile renderers, not the
                    Compatibility renderer.</emphasis></paragraph>
            <paragraph>Before enabling MSAA in 2D, it's important to understand what MSAA will operate
                on. MSAA in 2D follows similar restrictions as in 3D. While it does not
                introduce any blurriness, its scope of application is limited. The main
                applications of 2D MSAA are:</paragraph>
            <bullet_list bullet="-">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Geometry edges, such as line and polygon drawing.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Sprite edges <emphasis>only for pixels touching one of the texture's edges</emphasis>. This works
                        for both linear and nearest-neighbor filtering. Sprite edges created using
                        transparency on the image are not affected by MSAA.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
            </bullet_list>
            <paragraph>The downside of MSAA is that it only operates on edges. This is because MSAA
                increases the number of <emphasis>coverage</emphasis> samples, but not the number of <emphasis>color</emphasis>
                samples. However, since the number of color samples did not increase, fragment
                shaders are still run for each pixel only once. As a result, MSAA will <strong>not
                    affect</strong> the following kinds of aliasing in any way:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>MSAA can be enabled in the Project Settings by changing the value of the

                setting. It's important to change the value of the <strong>MSAA 2D</strong> setting and not <strong>MSAA 3D</strong>, as these are entirely
                separate settings.</paragraph>

                them touching the edges (green background) and 4 of them not touching the edges
