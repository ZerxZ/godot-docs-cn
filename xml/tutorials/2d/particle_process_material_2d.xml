            <paragraph>The properties in this material control how particles behave and change over their lifetime.
                A lot of them have <literal>Min</literal>, <literal>Max</literal>, and <literal>Curve</literal> values that allow you to fine-tune
                their behavior. The relationship between these values is this: When a particle is spawned,
                the property is set with a random value between <literal>Min</literal> and <literal>Max</literal>. If <literal>Min</literal> and <literal>Max</literal> are
                the same, the value will always be the same for every particle. If the <literal>Curve</literal> is also set,
                the value of the property will be multiplied by the value of the curve at the current point
                in a particle's lifetime. Use the curve to change a property over the particle lifetime. Very
                complex behavior can be expressed this way.</paragraph>
