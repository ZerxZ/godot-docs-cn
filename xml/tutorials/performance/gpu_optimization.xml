            <title>Introduction</title>
            <paragraph>The demand for new graphics features and progress almost guarantees that you
                will encounter graphics bottlenecks. Some of these can be on the CPU side, for
                instance in calculations inside the Godot engine to prepare objects for
                rendering. Bottlenecks can also occur on the CPU in the graphics driver, which
                sorts instructions to pass to the GPU, and in the transfer of these
                instructions. And finally, bottlenecks also occur on the GPU itself.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Where bottlenecks occur in rendering is highly hardware-specific.
                Mobile GPUs in particular may struggle with scenes that run easily on desktop.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Understanding and investigating GPU bottlenecks is slightly different to the
                situation on the CPU. This is because, often, you can only change performance
                indirectly by changing the instructions you give to the GPU. Also, it may be
                more difficult to take measurements. In many cases, the only way of measuring
                performance is by examining changes in the time spent rendering each frame.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>The following section is not relevant to end-users, but is useful to
                    provide background information that is relevant in later sections.</paragraph>
            </note>
            <paragraph>Godot sends instructions to the GPU via a graphics API (Vulkan, OpenGL, OpenGL
                ES or WebGL). The communication and driver activity involved can be quite
                costly, especially in OpenGL, OpenGL ES and WebGL. If we can provide these
                instructions in a way that is preferred by the driver and GPU, we can greatly
                increase performance.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Nearly every API command in OpenGL requires a certain amount of validation to
                make sure the GPU is in the correct state. Even seemingly simple commands can
                lead to a flurry of behind-the-scenes housekeeping. Therefore, the goal is to
                reduce these instructions to a bare minimum and group together similar objects
                as much as possible so they can be rendered together, or with the minimum number
                of these expensive state changes.</paragraph>

                <title>2D batching</title>
                <paragraph>In 2D, the costs of treating each item individually can be prohibitively high -
                    there can easily be thousands of them on the screen. This is why 2D <emphasis>batching</emphasis>
                    is used. Multiple similar items are grouped
                    together and rendered in a batch, via a single draw call, rather than making a
                    separate draw call for each item. In addition, this means state changes,
                    material and texture changes can be kept to a minimum.</paragraph>
            </section>
            <section ids="id1" names="3d\ batching">
                <title>3D batching</title>
                <paragraph>In 3D, we still aim to minimize draw calls and state changes. However, it can be
                    more difficult to batch together several objects into a single draw call. 3D
                    meshes tend to comprise hundreds or thousands of triangles, and combining large
                    meshes in real-time is prohibitively expensive. The costs of joining them quickly
                    exceeds any benefits as the number of triangles grows per mesh. A much better
                    alternative is to <strong>join meshes ahead of time</strong> (static meshes in relation to each
                    other). This can be done by artists, or programmatically within Godot using an add-on.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>There is also a cost to batching together objects in 3D. Several objects
                    rendered as one cannot be individually culled. An entire city that is off-screen
                    will still be rendered if it is joined to a single blade of grass that is on
                    screen. Thus, you should always take objects' locations and culling into account
                    when attempting to batch 3D objects together. Despite this, the benefits of
                    joining static objects often outweigh other considerations, especially for large
                    numbers of distant or low-poly objects.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>The Godot renderer is a little different to what is out there. It's designed to
                    minimize GPU state changes as much as possible. <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_standardmaterial3d#class-standardmaterial3d"><inline classes="std std-ref">StandardMaterial3D</inline></reference> does a good job at reusing materials that need similar

                    possible. Godot's priorities are:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>You may have heard that the lower the number of polygons in a model, the faster
                it will be rendered. This is <emphasis>really</emphasis> relative and depends on many factors.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>On a modern PC and console, vertex cost is low. GPUs originally only rendered
                triangles. This meant that every frame:</paragraph>
            <enumerated_list enumtype="arabic" prefix="" suffix=".">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>All vertices had to be transformed by the CPU (including clipping).</paragraph>

                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>All vertices had to be sent to the GPU memory from the main RAM.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
            </enumerated_list>
            <paragraph>Nowadays, all this is handled inside the GPU, greatly increasing performance. 3D
                artists usually have the wrong feeling about polycount performance because 3D
                modeling software (such as Blender, 3ds Max, etc.) need to keep geometry in CPU
                memory for it to be edited, reducing actual performance. Game engines rely on
                the GPU more, so they can render many triangles much more efficiently.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>On mobile devices, the story is different. PC and console GPUs are
                brute-force monsters that can pull as much electricity as they need from
                the power grid. Mobile GPUs are limited to a tiny battery, so they need
                to be a lot more power efficient.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To be more efficient, mobile GPUs attempt to avoid <emphasis>overdraw</emphasis>. Overdraw occurs
                when the same pixel on the screen is being rendered more than once. Imagine a
                town with several buildings. GPUs don't know what is visible and what is hidden
                until they draw it. For example, a house might be drawn and then another house
                in front of it (which means rendering happened twice for the same pixel). PC
                GPUs normally don't care much about this and just throw more pixel processors to
                the hardware to increase performance (which also increases power consumption).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Using more power is not an option on mobile so mobile devices use a technique
                called <emphasis>tile-based rendering</emphasis> which divides the screen into a grid. Each cell
                keeps the list of triangles drawn to it and sorts them by depth to minimize
                <emphasis>overdraw</emphasis>. This technique improves performance and reduces power consumption,
                but takes a toll on vertex performance. As a result, fewer vertices and
                triangles can be processed for drawing.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Additionally, tile-based rendering struggles when there are small objects with a
                lot of geometry within a small portion of the screen. This forces mobile GPUs to
                put a lot of strain on a single screen tile, which considerably decreases
                performance as all the other cells must wait for it to complete before
                displaying the frame.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To summarize, don't worry about vertex count on mobile, but
                <strong>avoid concentration of vertices in small parts of the screen</strong>.
                If a character, NPC, vehicle, etc. is far away (which means it looks tiny), use
                a smaller level of detail (LOD) model. Even on desktop GPUs, it's preferable to
                avoid having triangles smaller than the size of a pixel on screen.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Pay attention to the additional vertex processing required when using:</paragraph>

            <title>Pixel/fragment shaders and fill rate</title>
            <paragraph>In contrast to vertex processing, the costs of fragment (per-pixel) shading have
                increased dramatically over the years. Screen resolutions have increased: the
                area of a 4K screen is 8,294,400 pixels, versus 307,200 for an old 640×480 VGA
                screen. That is 27 times the area! Also, the complexity of fragment shaders has
                exploded. Physically-based rendering requires complex calculations for each
                fragment.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>You can test whether a project is fill rate-limited quite easily. Turn off
                V-Sync to prevent capping the frames per second, then compare the frames per
                second when running with a large window, to running with a very small window.
                You may also benefit from similarly reducing your shadow map size if using
                shadows. Usually, you will find the FPS increases quite a bit using a small
                window, which indicates you are to some extent fill rate-limited. On the other
                hand, if there is little to no increase in FPS, then your bottleneck lies
                elsewhere.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>You can increase performance in a fill rate-limited project by reducing the
                amount of work the GPU has to do. You can do this by simplifying the shader
                (perhaps turn off expensive options if you are using a <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_standardmaterial3d#class-standardmaterial3d"><inline classes="std std-ref">StandardMaterial3D</inline></reference>), or reducing the number and size of textures used.
                Also, when using non-unshaded particles, consider forcing vertex shading in
                their material to decrease the shading cost.</paragraph>
            <seealso>
                <paragraph>On supported hardware, <reference internal="True" refuri="../3d/variable_rate_shading#doc-variable-rate-shading"><inline classes="std std-ref">Variable rate shading</inline></reference> can be used to
                    reduce shading processing costs without impacting the sharpness of edges on
                    the final image.</paragraph>

                    you can reasonably afford to use.</strong></paragraph>

                <title>Reading textures</title>
                <paragraph>The other factor in fragment shaders is the cost of reading textures. Reading
                    textures is an expensive operation, especially when reading from several
                    textures in a single fragment shader. Also, consider that filtering may slow it
                    down further (trilinear filtering between mipmaps, and averaging). Reading
                    textures is also expensive in terms of power usage, which is a big issue on
                    mobiles.</paragraph>
                <paragraph><strong>If you use third-party shaders or write your own shaders, try to use
                        algorithms that require as few texture reads as possible.</strong></paragraph>

                <title>Texture compression</title>
                <paragraph>By default, Godot compresses textures of 3D models when imported using video RAM
                    (VRAM) compression. Video RAM compression isn't as efficient in size as PNG or
                    JPG when stored, but increases performance enormously when drawing large enough
                    textures.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>This is because the main goal of texture compression is bandwidth reduction
                    between memory and the GPU.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>In 3D, the shapes of objects depend more on the geometry than the texture, so
                    compression is generally not noticeable. In 2D, compression depends more on
                    shapes inside the textures, so the artifacts resulting from 2D compression are
                    more noticeable.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>As a warning, most Android devices do not support texture compression of
                    textures with transparency (only opaque), so keep this in mind.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Even in 3D, "pixel art" textures should have VRAM compression disabled as it
                        will negatively affect their appearance, without improving performance

            <title>Transparency and blending</title>
            <paragraph>Transparent objects present particular problems for rendering efficiency. Opaque
                objects (especially in 3D) can be essentially rendered in any order and the
                Z-buffer will ensure that only the front most objects get shaded. Transparent or
                blended objects are different. In most cases, they cannot rely on the Z-buffer
                and must be rendered in "painter's order" (i.e. from back to front) to look
                correct.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Transparent objects are also particularly bad for fill rate, because every item
                has to be drawn even if other transparent objects will be drawn on top
                later on.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Opaque objects don't have to do this. They can usually take advantage of the
                Z-buffer by writing to the Z-buffer only first, then only performing the
                fragment shader on the "winning" fragment, the object that is at the front at a
                particular pixel.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Transparency is particularly expensive where multiple transparent objects
                overlap. It is usually better to use transparent areas as small as possible to
                minimize these fill rate requirements, especially on mobile, where fill rate is
                very expensive. Indeed, in many situations, rendering more complex opaque
                geometry can end up being faster than using transparency to "cheat".</paragraph>

                from GPUs on desktop. Most mobile devices use tile renderers. Tile renderers
                split up the screen into regular-sized tiles that fit into super fast cache
                memory, which reduces the number of read/write operations to the main memory.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>There are some downsides though. Tiled rendering can make certain techniques
                much more complicated and expensive to perform. Tiles that rely on the results
                of rendering in different tiles or on the results of earlier operations being
                preserved can be very slow. Be very careful to test the performance of shaders,
                viewport textures and post processing.</paragraph>
