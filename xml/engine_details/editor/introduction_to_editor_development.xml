        <paragraph>This guide is aimed at current or future engine contributors.
            To create editor plugins in GDScript, see <reference internal="True" refuri="../../tutorials/plugins/editor/making_plugins#doc-making-plugins"><inline classes="std std-ref">Making plugins</inline></reference> instead.</paragraph>
        <seealso>
            <paragraph>If you are new to Godot, we recommended you to read
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../../getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy#doc-godot-design-philosophy"><inline classes="std std-ref">Godot's design philosophy</inline></reference> before continuing. Since the Godot editor
                is a Godot project written in C++, much of the engine's philosophy applies
                to the editor.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The Godot editor is drawn using Godot's renderer and
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../../tutorials/ui/index#doc-user-interface"><inline classes="std std-ref">UI system</inline></reference>. It does <emphasis>not</emphasis> rely on a toolkit
                such as GTK or Qt. This is similar in spirit to software like Blender.
                While using toolkits makes it easier to achieve a "native" appearance, they are
                also quite heavy and their licensing is not compatible with Godot's.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The editor is fully written in C++. It can't contain any GDScript or C# code.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The editor's code is fully self-contained in the
                <reference name="editor/" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/editor">editor/</reference> folder
                of the Godot source repository.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Some editor functionality is also implemented via
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../architecture/custom_modules_in_cpp#doc-custom-modules-in-cpp"><inline classes="std std-ref">modules</inline></reference>. Some of these are only enabled in
                editor builds to decrease the binary size of export templates. See the

            <title>Editor dependencies in <literal>scene/</literal> files</title>
            <paragraph>When working on an editor feature, you may have to modify files in
                Godot's GUI nodes, which you can find in the <literal>scene/</literal> folder.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>One rule to keep in mind is that you must <strong>not</strong> introduce new dependencies to
                <literal>editor/</literal> includes in other folders such as <literal>scene/</literal>. This applies even if
                you use <literal>#ifdef TOOLS_ENABLED</literal>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To make the codebase easier to follow and more self-contained, the allowed
                dependency order is:</paragraph>
            <bullet_list bullet="-">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph><literal>editor/</literal> -&gt; <literal>scene/</literal> -&gt; <literal>servers/</literal> -&gt; <literal>core/</literal></paragraph>
                </list_item>
            </bullet_list>
            <paragraph>This means that files in <literal>editor/</literal> can depend on includes from <literal>scene/</literal>,
                <literal>servers/</literal>, and <literal>core/</literal>. But, for example, while <literal>scene/</literal> can depend on includes
                from <literal>servers/</literal> and <literal>core/</literal>, it cannot depend on includes from <literal>editor/</literal>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Currently, there are some dependencies to <literal>editor/</literal> includes in <literal>scene/</literal>
                files, but
                <reference name="they are in the process of being removed" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/53295">they are in the process of being removed</reference>.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>To iterate quickly on the editor, we recommend to set up a test project and
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../../tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial#doc-command-line-tutorial"><inline classes="std std-ref">open it from the command line</inline></reference> after compiling
                the editor. This way, you don't have to go through the Project Manager every
                time you start Godot.</paragraph>
