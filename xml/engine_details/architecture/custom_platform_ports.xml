        <paragraph>Similar to <reference internal="True" refuri="custom_modules_in_cpp#doc-custom-modules-in-cpp"><inline classes="std std-ref">Custom modules in C++</inline></reference>, Godot's multi-platform architecture
            is designed in a way that allows creating platform ports without modifying any
            existing source code.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>An example of a custom platform port distributed independently from the engine
            is <reference name="FRT" refuri="https://github.com/efornara/frt">FRT</reference>, which targets single-board
            computers. Note that this platform port currently targets Godot 3.x; therefore,
            it does not use the <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_displayserver#class-displayserver"><inline classes="std std-ref">DisplayServer</inline></reference> abstraction that is new in Godot 4.</paragraph>

                    requires signing NDAs with console manufacturers, but it allows you to have
                    full control over the console porting process.</paragraph>

        <note>
            <paragraph>Godot is a modern engine with modern requirements. Even if you only
                intend to run simple 2D projects on the target platform, it still requires
                an amount of memory that makes it unviable to run on most retro consoles.
                For reference, in Godot 4, an empty project with nothing visible requires
                about 100 MB of RAM to run on Linux (50 MB in headless mode).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If you want to run Godot on heavily memory-constrained platforms, older
                Godot versions have lower memory requirements. The porting process is
                similar, with the exception of <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_displayserver#class-displayserver"><inline classes="std std-ref">DisplayServer</inline></reference> not being split
                from the <reference internal="True" refuri="../../classes/class_os#class-os"><inline classes="std std-ref">OS</inline></reference> singleton.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Platform ports are designed to be as self-contained as possible. Most of the
                code can be kept within a single folder located in <literal>platform/</literal>. Like
                <reference internal="True" refuri="custom_modules_in_cpp#doc-custom-modules-in-cpp"><inline classes="std std-ref">Custom modules in C++</inline></reference>, this allows for streamlining the build process
                by making it possible to <literal>git clone</literal> a platform folder within a Godot repository
                clone's <literal>platform/</literal> folder, then run <literal>scons platform=&lt;name&gt;</literal>. No other steps are
                necessary for building, unless third-party platform-specific dependencies need
                to be installed first.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>However, when a custom rendering driver is needed, another folder must be added
                in <literal>drivers/</literal>. In this case, the platform port can be distributed as a fork of
                the Godot repository, or as a collection of several folders that can be added
                over a Godot Git repository clone.</paragraph>
