        <title>Using C++ profilers</title>
        <paragraph>To optimize Godot's performance, you need to know what to optimize first.
            To this end, profilers are useful tools.</paragraph>
        <note>
            <paragraph>There is a <reference internal="True" refuri="../../../tutorials/scripting/debug/the_profiler#doc-the-profiler"><inline classes="std std-ref">built-in GDScript profiler</inline></reference> in the editor,
                but using C++ profiler may be useful in cases where the GDScript profiler
                is not accurate enough or is missing information due to bugs in the profiler.</paragraph>
        </note>
        <paragraph>There are two main types of profilers: sampling profilers and tracing profilers.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Sampling profilers periodically interrupt the running program and take a "sample",
            which records which functions are running. Using this information, the profiler
            estimates which functions the program spent the most time in.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Tracing profilers work by recording application-specific events (such as the
            start and end of a single frame), producing a log called a "trace". The profiler
            can use the trace to produce a graph showing an accurate high-level timeline of
            what happened. However, any code that is not explicitly instrumented will not
            appear in a tracing profiler's timeline!</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Godot supports both sampling profilers and tracing profilers, and already
            includes the logging code for common Godot events for use with a tracing profiler!</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Different problems may be easier to debug with one kind of profiler over the other,
            but it's difficult to provide a set of rules for which to use. Give both a try,
            and see what you can learn from them!</paragraph>
