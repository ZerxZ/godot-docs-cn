            <title>Downloading the Godot source code</title>
            <paragraph>Before <reference internal="True" refuri="introduction_to_the_buildsystem#doc-introduction-to-the-buildsystem"><inline classes="std std-ref">getting into the SCons build system</inline></reference>
                and compiling Godot, you need to actually download the Godot source code.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The source code is available on <reference name="GitHub" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot">GitHub</reference>
                and while you can manually download it via the website, in general you want to
                do it via the <literal>git</literal> version control system.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If you are compiling in order to make contributions or pull requests, you should
                follow the instructions from the <reference name="Pull Request workflow" refuri="https://contributing.godotengine.org/en/latest/organization/pull_requests/creating_pull_requests.html">Pull Request workflow</reference>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If you don't know much about <literal>git</literal> yet, there are a great number of
                <reference name="tutorials" refuri="https://git-scm.com/book">tutorials</reference> available on various websites.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In general, you need to install <literal>git</literal> and/or one of the various GUI clients.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Afterwards, to get the latest development version of the Godot source code
                (the unstable <literal>master</literal> branch), you can use <literal>git clone</literal>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If you are using the <literal>git</literal> command line client, this is done by entering
                the following in a terminal:</paragraph>
            <literal_block force="False" language="shell" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">git clone https://github.com/godotengine/godot.git
# You can add the --depth 1 argument to omit the commit history (shallow clone).
# A shallow clone is faster, but not all Git operations (like blame) will work.</literal_block>
            <paragraph>For any stable release, visit the <reference name="release page" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases">release page</reference>
                and click on the link for the release you want.
                You can then download and extract the source from the download link on the page.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>With <literal>git</literal>, you can also clone a stable release by specifying its branch or tag
                after the <literal>--branch</literal> (or just <literal>-b</literal>) argument:</paragraph>
            <literal_block force="False" language="shell" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve"># Clone the continuously maintained stable branch (`4.4` as of writing).
git clone https://github.com/godotengine/godot.git -b 4.4

# Clone the `4.4-stable` tag. This is a fixed revision that will never change.
git clone https://github.com/godotengine/godot.git -b 4.4-stable

# After cloning, optionally go to a specific commit.
# This can be used to access the source code at a specific point in time,
# e.g. for development snapshots, betas and release candidates.
cd godot
git checkout f4af8201bac157b9d47e336203d3e8a8ef729de2</literal_block>
            <paragraph>The <reference name="maintenance branches" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/branches/all">maintenance branches</reference>
                are used to release further patches on each minor version.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>You can get the source code for each release and pre-release in <literal>.tar.xz</literal> format from
                <reference name="godotengine/godot-builds on GitHub" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-builds/releases">godotengine/godot-builds on GitHub</reference>.
                This lacks version control information but has a slightly smaller download size.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>After downloading the Godot source code,
                you can <reference internal="True" refuri="introduction_to_the_buildsystem#doc-introduction-to-the-buildsystem"><inline classes="std std-ref">continue to compiling Godot</inline></reference>.</paragraph>
