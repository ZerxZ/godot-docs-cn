        <title>TSCN file format</title>
        <paragraph>The TSCN (text scene) file format represents a single scene tree inside
            Godot. Unlike binary SCN files, TSCN files have the advantage of being mostly
            human-readable and easy for version control systems to manage.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The ESCN (exported scene) file format is identical to the TSCN file format, but
            is used to indicate to Godot that the file has been exported from another
            program and should not be edited by the user from within Godot.
            Unlike SCN and TSCN files, during import, ESCN files are compiled to binary
            SCN files stored inside the <literal>.godot/imported/</literal> folder.
            This reduces the data size and speeds up loading, as binary formats are faster
            to load compared to text-based formats.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>To make files more compact, properties equal to the default value are not stored
            in scene/resource files. It is possible to write them manually, but they will be
            discarded when saving the file.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>For those looking for a complete description, the parsing is handled in the file
            <reference name="resource_format_text.cpp" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/scene/resources/resource_format_text.cpp">resource_format_text.cpp</reference><target ids="resource-format-text-cpp" names="resource_format_text.cpp" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/scene/resources/resource_format_text.cpp"></target>
            in the <literal>ResourceFormatLoaderText</literal> class.</paragraph>
        <note>
            <paragraph>The scene and resource file formats have changed significantly in Godot 4,
                with the introduction of string-based UIDs to replace incremental integer
                IDs.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Mesh, skeleton and animation data is also stored differently compared to Godot 3.
                You can read about some of the changes in this article:

            <paragraph>Scenes and resources saved with Godot 4.x contain <literal>format=3</literal> in their
                header, whereas Godot 3.x uses <literal>format=2</literal> instead.</paragraph>

            <title>File structure</title>
            <paragraph>There are five main sections inside the TSCN file:</paragraph>
            <enumerated_list enumtype="arabic" prefix="" start="0" suffix=".">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>File descriptor</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>External resources</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Internal resources</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Nodes</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Connections</paragraph>
                </list_item>
            </enumerated_list>
            <paragraph>The file descriptor looks like <literal>[gd_scene load_steps=4 format=3 uid="uid://cecaux1sm7mo0"]</literal>
                and should be the first entry in the file. The <literal>load_steps</literal> parameter is equal to the
                total amount of resources (internal and external) plus one (for the file itself).
                If the file has no resources, <literal>load_steps</literal> is omitted. The engine will
                still load the file correctly if <literal>load_steps</literal> is incorrect, but this will affect
                loading bars and any other piece of code relying on that value.</paragraph>
            <paragraph><literal>uid</literal> is a unique string-based identifier representing the scene. This is
                used by the engine to track files that are moved around, even while the editor
                is closed. Scripts can also load UID-based resources using the <literal>uid://</literal> path
                prefix to avoid relying on filesystem paths. This makes it possible to move
                around a file in the project, but still be able to load it in scripts without
                having to modify the script. Godot does not use external files to keep track of
                IDs, which means no central metadata storage location is required within the
                project. See <reference name="this pull request" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/50786">this pull request</reference>
                for detailed information.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>These sections should appear in order, but it can be hard to distinguish them.
                The only difference between them is the first element in the heading for all of
                the items in the section. For example, the heading of all external resources
                should start with <literal>[ext_resource ...]</literal>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>A TSCN file may contain single-line comments starting with a semicolon (<literal>;</literal>).
                However, comments will be discarded when saving the file using the Godot editor.
                Whitespace within a TSCN file is not significant (except within strings), but
                extraneous whitespace will be discarded when saving the file.</paragraph>

                    so on. For example, a Node3D looks like:</paragraph>

                <title>NodePath</title>
                <paragraph>A tree structure is not enough to represent the whole scene. Godot uses a
                    <literal>NodePath(Path/To/Node)</literal> structure to refer to another node or attribute of
                    the node anywhere in the scene tree. Paths are relative to the current node,
                    with <literal>NodePath(".")</literal> pointing to the current node and <literal>NodePath("")</literal>
                    pointing to no node at all.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>For instance, MeshInstance3D uses <literal>NodePath()</literal> to point to its skeleton.
                    Likewise, Animation tracks use <literal>NodePath()</literal> to point to node properties to
                    animate.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>NodePath can also point to a property using a <literal>:property_name</literal> suffix, and
                    even point to a specific component for vector, transform and color types. This
                    is used by Animation resources to point to specific properties to animate. For
                    example, <literal>NodePath("MeshInstance3D:scale.x")</literal> points to the <literal>x</literal> component of
                    the <literal>scale</literal> Vector3 property in MeshInstance3D.</paragraph>

            <title>Resources</title>
            <paragraph>Resources are components that make up the nodes. For example, a MeshInstance3D
                node will have an accompanying ArrayMesh resource. The ArrayMesh resource
                may be either internal or external to the TSCN file.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>References to the resources are handled by unique string-based IDs in the
                resource's heading. This is different from the <literal>uid</literal> property, which each
                external resource also has (but subresources don't).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>External resources and internal resources are referred to with
                <literal>ExtResource("id")</literal> and <literal>SubResource("id")</literal>, respectively. Because there
                have different methods to refer to internal and external resources, you can have
                the same ID for both an internal and external resource.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For example, to refer to the resource
                <literal>[ext_resource type="Material" uid="uid://c4cp0al3ljsjv" path="res://material.tres" id="1_7bt6s"]</literal>,
                you would use <literal>ExtResource("1_7bt6s")</literal>.</paragraph>
            <section ids="external-resources" names="external\ resources">
                <title>External resources</title>
                <paragraph>External resources are links to resources not contained within the TSCN file
                    itself. An external resource consists of a path, a type, a UID (used to map its
                    filesystem location to a unique identifier) and an ID (used to refer to the
                    resource in the scene file).</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Godot always generates absolute paths relative to the resource directory and
                    thus prefixed with <literal>res://</literal>, but paths relative to the TSCN file's location
                    are also valid.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Some example external resources are:</paragraph>
                <literal_block force="False" language="gdscript" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">[ext_resource type="Texture2D" uid="uid://ccbm14ebjmpy1" path="res://gradient.tres" id="2_eorut"]
[ext_resource type="Material" uid="uid://c4cp0al3ljsjv" path="material.tres" id="1_7bt6s"]</literal_block>
                <paragraph>Like TSCN files, a TRES file may contain single-line comments starting with a
                    semicolon (<literal>;</literal>). However, comments will be discarded when saving the resource
                    using the Godot editor.
                    Whitespace within a TRES file is not significant (except within strings), but
                    extraneous whitespace will be discarded when saving the file.</paragraph>

                <title>Internal resources</title>
                <paragraph>A TSCN file can contain meshes, materials and other data. These are contained in
                    the <emphasis>internal resources</emphasis> section of the file. The heading for an internal
                    resource looks similar to those of external resources, except that it doesn't
                    have a path. Internal resources also have <literal>key=value</literal> pairs under each
                    heading. For example, a capsule collision shape looks like:</paragraph>
                <literal_block force="False" language="gdscript" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">[sub_resource type="CapsuleShape3D" id="CapsuleShape3D_fdxgg"]
radius = 1.0
height = 3.0</literal_block>
                <paragraph>Some internal resources contain links to other internal resources (such as a
                    mesh having a material). In this case, the referring resource must appear
                    <emphasis>before</emphasis> the reference to it. This means that order matters in the file's
                    internal resources section.</paragraph>
