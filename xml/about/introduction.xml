            <title>About Godot Engine</title>
            <paragraph>A game engine is a complex tool and difficult to present in a few words.
                Here's a quick synopsis, which you are free to reuse
                if you need a quick write-up about Godot Engine:</paragraph>
            <block_quote>
                <paragraph>Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D
                    and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of
                    common tools, so that users can focus on making games without having to
                    reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a number of
                    platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows),
                    mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms and consoles.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Godot is completely free and open source under the <reference internal="True" refuri="complying_with_licenses#doc-complying-with-licenses"><inline classes="std std-ref">permissive MIT
                            license</inline></reference>. No strings attached, no royalties,
                    nothing. Users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code.
                    Godot's development is fully independent and community-driven, empowering
                    users to help shape their engine to match their expectations.
                    It is supported by the <reference name="Godot Foundation" refuri="https://godot.foundation/">Godot Foundation</reference><target ids="godot-foundation" names="godot\ foundation" refuri="https://godot.foundation/"></target>
                    not-for-profit.</paragraph>
