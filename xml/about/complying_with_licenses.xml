            <paragraph>Godot is created and distributed under the <reference name="MIT License" refuri="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</reference><target ids="mit-license" names="mit\ license" refuri="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"></target>.
                It doesn't have a sole owner, as every contributor that submits code to
                the project does it under this same license and keeps ownership of their
                contribution.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The license is the legal requirement for you (or your company) to use and
                distribute the software (and derivative projects, including games made with it).
                Your game or project can have a different license, but it still needs to comply
                with the original one.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>This section covers compliance with licenses from a user perspective.
                    If you are interested in licence compliance as a contributor, you can find
                    guidelines <reference name="here" refuri="https://contributing.godotengine.org/en/latest/engine/guidelines/best_practices.html#don-t-use-complex-canned-solutions-for-simple-problems">here</reference>.</paragraph>
            </note>
            <tip>
                <paragraph>Alongside the Godot license text, remember to also list third-party notices
                    for assets you're using, such as textures, models, sounds, music and fonts.
                    This includes free assets, which often come with licenses that require
                    attribution.</paragraph>

                <tip>
                    <paragraph>Godot provides several methods to get license information in the

                        license information directly from the engine binary, which prevents the
                        information from becoming outdated if you update engine versions.</paragraph>

                which is compatible with, but not covered by Godot's MIT license.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Many of these dependencies are distributed under permissive open source licenses
                which require attribution by explicitly citing their copyright statement and
                license text in the final product's documentation.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Given the scope of the Godot project, this is fairly difficult to do thoroughly.
                For the Godot editor, the full documentation of third-party copyrights and
                licenses is provided in the <reference name="COPYRIGHT.txt" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.txt">COPYRIGHT.txt</reference><target ids="copyright-txt" names="copyright.txt" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.txt"></target>
                file.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>A good option for end users to document third-party licenses is to include this
                file in your project's distribution, which you can e.g. rename to
                <literal>GODOT_COPYRIGHT.txt</literal> to prevent any confusion with your own code and assets.</paragraph>
