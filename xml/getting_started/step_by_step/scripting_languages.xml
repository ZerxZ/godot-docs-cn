        <title>Scripting languages</title>
        <paragraph>This lesson will give you an overview of the available scripting languages in
            Godot. You will learn the pros and cons of each option. In the next part, you
            will write your first script using GDScript.</paragraph>
        <paragraph><strong>Scripts attach to a node and extend its behavior</strong>. This means that scripts
            inherit all functions and properties of the node they attach to.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>For example, take a game where a Camera2D node follows a ship. The Camera2D node
            follows its parent by default. Imagine you want the camera to shake when the player
            takes damage. As this feature is not built into Godot, you would attach a script
            to the Camera2D node and code the shake.</paragraph>

            <title>Available scripting languages</title>
            <paragraph>Godot offers <strong>four gameplay programming languages</strong>: GDScript, C#,
                and, via its GDExtension technology, C and C++. There are more
                community-supported languages, but these are the official ones.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>You can use multiple languages in a single project. For instance, in a team, you
                could code gameplay logic in GDScript as it's fast to write, and use C# or C++ to
                implement complex algorithms and maximize their performance. Or you can write
                everything in GDScript or C#. It's your call.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>We provide this flexibility to answer the needs of different game projects and
                developers.</paragraph>

            <title>Which language should I use?</title>
            <paragraph>If you're a beginner, we recommend to <strong>start with GDScript</strong>. We made this
                language specifically for Godot and the needs of game developers. It has a
                lightweight and straightforward syntax and provides the tightest integration
                with Godot.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>For C#, you will need an external code editor like
                <reference name="VSCode" refuri="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</reference><target ids="vscode" names="vscode" refuri="https://code.visualstudio.com/"></target> or Visual Studio. While C# support is
                now mature, you will find fewer learning resources for it compared to
                GDScript. That's why we recommend C# mainly to users who already have experience
                with the language.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Let's look at each language's features, as well as its pros and cons.</paragraph>

                    programming language built for Godot. It's made by and for game developers
                    to save you time coding games. Its features include:</paragraph>

                            this feature eventually gets in the way when creating games. The engine counts
                            references and manages the memory for you in most cases by default, but you
                            can also control memory if you need to.</paragraph>

                            have dynamic types by default, but you also can use type hints for strong type

                <paragraph>GDScript looks like Python as you structure your code blocks using indentations,
                    but it doesn't work the same way in practice. It's inspired by multiple
                    languages, including Squirrel, Lua, and Python.</paragraph>
                <note>
                    <paragraph>Why don't we use Python or Lua directly?</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Years ago, Godot used Python, then Lua. Both languages' integration took a
                        lot of work and had severe limitations. For example, threading support was a
                        big challenge with Python.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Developing a dedicated language doesn't take us more work and we can tailor
                        it to game developers' needs. We're now working on performance optimizations
                        and features that would've been difficult to offer with third-party
                        languages.</paragraph>

                    amongst game developers, we officially support it. C# is a mature and flexible
                    language with tons of libraries written for it. We were able to add support for it
                    thanks to a generous donation from Microsoft.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>C# offers a good tradeoff between performance and ease of use, although you
                    should be aware of its garbage collector.</paragraph>
                <note>
                    <paragraph>You must use the .NET edition of the Godot editor to script in C#. You
                        can download it on the Godot website's <reference name="download" refuri="https://godotengine.org/download/">download</reference><target ids="download" names="download" refuri="https://godotengine.org/download/"></target> page.</paragraph>
                </note>
                <paragraph>Since Godot uses .NET 8, in theory, you can use any third-party .NET library or
                    framework in Godot, as well as any Common Language Infrastructure-compliant
                    programming language, such as F#, Boo, or ClojureCLR. However, C# is the only
                    officially supported .NET option.</paragraph>
                <note>
                    <paragraph>GDScript code itself doesn't execute as fast as compiled C# or C++.
                        However, most script code calls functions written with fast algorithms
                        in C++ code inside the engine. In many cases, writing gameplay logic
                        in GDScript, C#, or C++ won't have a significant impact on
                        performance.</paragraph>

                <attention>
                    <paragraph>Projects written in C# using Godot 4 currently cannot be exported to the web
                        platform. To use C# on that platform, consider Godot 3 instead.
                        Android and iOS platform support is available as of Godot 4.2, but is
                        experimental and <reference internal="True" refuri="../../tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/index#doc-c-sharp-platforms"><inline classes="std std-ref">some limitations apply</inline></reference>.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>GDExtension is the best choice for performance. You don't need to use it
