        <title>Introduction to Godot</title>
        <paragraph>This article is here to help you figure out whether Godot might be a good fit
            for you. We will introduce some broad features of the engine to give you a feel
            for what you can achieve with it and answer questions such as "what do I need to
            know to get started?".</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This is by no means an exhaustive overview. We will introduce many more features
            in this getting started series.</paragraph>

            <title>What is Godot?</title>
            <paragraph>Godot is a general-purpose 2D and 3D game engine designed to support all sorts
                of projects. You can use it to create games or applications you can then release
                on desktop or mobile, as well as on the web.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>You can also create console games with it, although you either need strong
                programming skills or a developer to port the game for you.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>The Godot team can't provide an open source console export due to the
                    licensing terms imposed by console manufacturers. Regardless of the
                    engine you use, though, releasing games on consoles is always a lot of
                    work. You can read more on that here: <reference internal="True" refuri="../../tutorials/platform/consoles#doc-consoles"><inline classes="std std-ref">Console support in Godot</inline></reference>.</paragraph>

            <title>What can the engine do?</title>
            <paragraph>Godot was initially developed in-house by an Argentinian game studio. Its
                development started in 2001, and the engine was rewritten and improved
                tremendously since its open source release in 2014.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Some examples of games created with Godot include Cassette Beasts, PVKK, and
                Usagi Shima. As for applications, the open source pixel art drawing program
                Pixelorama is powered by Godot, and so is the voxel RPG creator RPG in a Box.
                You can find many more examples in the <reference name="Official Showcase" refuri="https://godotengine.org/showcase/">Official Showcase</reference><target ids="official-showcase" names="official\ showcase" refuri="https://godotengine.org/showcase/"></target>.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Godot comes with a fully-fledged game editor with integrated tools to answer the
                most common needs. It includes a code editor, an animation editor, a tilemap
                editor, a shader editor, a debugger, a profiler, and more.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The team strives to offer a feature-rich game editor with a consistent user
                experience. While there is always room for improvement, the user interface keeps
                getting refined.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Of course, if you prefer, you can work with external programs. We officially
                support importing 3D scenes designed in <reference name="Blender" refuri="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</reference> and maintain plugins to code in
                <reference name="VSCode" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-vscode-plugin">VSCode</reference> and <reference name="Emacs" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/emacs-gdscript-mode">Emacs</reference> for GDScript and C#. We also support Visual Studio for C# on
                Windows.</paragraph>

            <title>Programming languages</title>
            <paragraph>Let's talk about the available programming languages.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>You can code your games using <reference internal="True" refuri="../../tutorials/scripting/gdscript/index#doc-gdscript"><inline classes="std std-ref">GDScript</inline></reference>, a
                Godot-specific and tightly integrated language with a lightweight syntax, or
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../../tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/index#doc-c-sharp"><inline classes="std std-ref">C#</inline></reference>, which is popular in the games industry.
                These are the two main scripting languages we support.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>With the <reference internal="True" refuri="../../tutorials/scripting/gdextension/what_is_gdextension#doc-what-is-gdextension"><inline classes="std std-ref">GDExtension</inline></reference> technology, you can also
                write gameplay or high-performance algorithms in <reference internal="True" refuri="../../tutorials/scripting/cpp/index#doc-godot-cpp"><inline classes="std std-ref">C++</inline></reference> or
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../../tutorials/scripting/other_languages#doc-scripting-languages"><inline classes="std std-ref">other languages</inline></reference> without recompiling the engine.
                You can use this technology to integrate third-party libraries and other
                Software Development Kits (SDK) in the engine.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Of course, you can also directly add modules and features to the engine, as it's
                completely free and open source.</paragraph>

            <title>What do I need to know to use Godot?</title>
            <paragraph>Godot is a feature-packed game engine. With its thousands of features, there is
                a lot to learn. To make the most of it, you need good programming foundations.
                While we try to make the engine accessible, you will benefit a lot from knowing
                how to think like a programmer first.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Godot relies on the object-oriented programming paradigm. Being comfortable with
                concepts such as classes and objects will help you code efficiently in it.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If you are entirely new to programming, GDQuest's <emphasis>Learn GDScript From Zero</emphasis>
                is a free and open source interactive tutorial for absolute beginners to
                learn to program with Godot's GDScript language. It is available as a
                <reference name="desktop application" refuri="https://gdquest.itch.io/learn-godot-gdscript">desktop application</reference>
                or <reference name="in the browser" refuri="https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript">in the browser</reference>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>We will provide you with more Godot-specific learning resources in
