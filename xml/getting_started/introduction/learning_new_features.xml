        <title>Learning new features</title>
        <paragraph>Godot is a feature-rich game engine. There is a lot to learn about it. This page
            explains how you can use the online manual, built-in code reference, and join
            online communities to learn new features and techniques.</paragraph>
        <section ids="making-the-most-of-this-manual" names="making\ the\ most\ of\ this\ manual">
            <title>Making the most of this manual</title>
            <paragraph>What you are reading now is the user manual. It documents each of the engine's
                concepts and available features. When learning a new topic, you can start by
                browsing the corresponding section of this website. The left menu allows you to
                explore broad topics while the search bar will help you find more specific
                pages. If a page exists for a given theme, it will often link to more related
                content.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The manual has a companion class reference that explains each Godot class's
                available functions and properties when programming. While the manual covers
                general features, concepts, and how to use the editor, the reference is all
                about using Godot's scripting API (Application Programming Interface). You can
                access it both online and offline. We recommend browsing the reference offline,
                from within the Godot editor. To do so, go to Help -&gt; Search Help or press
                <literal classes="kbd">F1</literal>.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Where the class exists in the inheritance hierarchy. You can click the top
                        links to jump to parent classes and see the properties and methods a type

            <note>
                <paragraph>If the manual or class reference is missing or has insufficient
                    information, please open an Issue in the official <reference name="godot-docs" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues">godot-docs</reference><target ids="godot-docs" names="godot-docs" refuri="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues"></target> GitHub repository

            </note>
            <paragraph>You can hold <literal classes="kbd">Ctrl</literal> (macOS <literal classes="kbd">Cmd</literal>) and then mouseover text like the name of a class, property,
                method, signal, or constant to underline it, then <literal classes="kbd">Ctrl + Click</literal> (macOS <literal classes="kbd">Cmd + Click</literal>) it to jump to it.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Godot has a growing community of users. If you're stuck on a problem or need
                help to better understand how to achieve something, you can ask other users for
                help on one of the many <reference name="active communities" refuri="https://godotengine.org/community">active
                    communities</reference><target ids="active-communities" names="active\ communities" refuri="https://godotengine.org/community"></target>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The best place to ask questions and find already answered ones is the
                official <reference name="Godot Forum" refuri="https://forum.godotengine.org/">Godot Forum</reference><target ids="godot-forum" names="godot\ forum" refuri="https://forum.godotengine.org/"></target>. These
                responses show up in search engine results and get saved, allowing other users
                to benefit from discussions on the platform. Once you have asked a question there,
                you can share its link on other social platforms. Before asking a question, be
                sure to look for existing answers that might solve your problem on this website
                or using your preferred search engine.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Asking questions well and providing details will help others answer you faster
                and better. When asking questions, we recommend including the following
                information:</paragraph>
            <enumerated_list enumtype="arabic" prefix="" suffix=".">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph><strong>Describe your goal</strong>. You want to explain what you are trying to achieve
                        design-wise. If you are having trouble figuring out how to make a solution
                        work, there may be a different, easier solution that accomplishes the same
                        goal.</paragraph>

                        can copy the exact error message in the editor's Debugger bottom panel by
                        clicking the Copy Error icon. Knowing what it says can help community members
                        better identify how you triggered the error.</paragraph>

                        to help you fix a problem without seeing your code. Share the code as text
                        directly. To do so, you can copy and paste a short code snippet in a chat
                        box, or use a website like <reference name="Pastebin" refuri="https://pastebin.com/">Pastebin</reference><target ids="pastebin" names="pastebin" refuri="https://pastebin.com/"></target> to share long

                        the code you write affects nodes in your scenes. As a result, you should
                        think of those scenes as part of your source code.</paragraph>
