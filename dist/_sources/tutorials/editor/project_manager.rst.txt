Using the Project Manager
=========================

When you launch Godot, the first window you see is the Project Manager. It lets
you create, remove, import, or play game projects.

In the window's top-right corner, a drop-down menu allows you to change the
editor's language.

When you see the green tick on the right, it means the engine detects an empty
folder. You can also click the **Create Folder** button to create an empty
folder based on your project's name.

Opening and importing projects
------------------------------

The next time you open the Project Manager, you'll see your new project in the
list. Double click on it to open it in the editor.

You can similarly import existing projects using the **Import** button. Locate the
folder that contains the project or the **project.godot** file to import and
edit it.

When the folder path is correct, you'll see a green checkmark.
