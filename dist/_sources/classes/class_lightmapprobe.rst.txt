=============

**Inherits:** :ref:`Node3D<class_Node3D>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_Node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Represents a single manually placed probe for dynamic object lighting with :ref:`LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>`.

Description
-----------

**LightmapProbe** represents the position of a single manually placed probe for dynamic object lighting with :ref:`LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>`.

Typically, :ref:`LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>` probes are placed automatically by setting :ref:`LightmapGI.generate_probes_subdiv<class_LightmapGI_property_generate_probes_subdiv>` to a value other than :ref:`LightmapGI.GENERATE_PROBES_DISABLED<class_LightmapGI_constant_GENERATE_PROBES_DISABLED>`. By creating **LightmapProbe** nodes before baking lightmaps, you can add more probes in specific areas for greater detail, or disable automatic generation and rely only on manually placed probes instead.
